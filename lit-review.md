<h2 class="center-text">Leading and Managing Change at Algonquin College</h2>

In keeping with the mandate of Ontario’s publicly supported colleges to respond to ever-changing employment needs in the community {% cite noauthor_ontario_2002 %}, the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College has maintained strong relations with local, sector-specific employers. The faculty are practicing graphic designers who maintain expansive professional networks. One key component of the program’s success is the provision of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) experiences, though the quality and consistency of these activities is deteriorating with time. This paper presents a literature review focused on leading and managing change that aims to build sustained stakeholder engagement and to have WIL be an embedded learning model in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College.

The review examines scholarly works addressing the challenges of implementing sustained, high-quality WIL in the program, with a focus on leading and managing change. The scope includes peer-reviewed studies analyzing stakeholder engagement barriers, and leadership strategies. This review aims to identify evidence-based practices for embedding WIL as a core pedagogical model while addressing faculty workload constraints and inconsistent industry participation.

The analysis has the following structure: current deficiencies in WIL delivery, definitions of quality across stakeholders, leadership approaches for overcoming resistance to change, and mechanisms for sustaining engagement. By evaluating sources through the lens of Kotter’s change management theory, and Deming’s continuous improvement framework, this review contends that WIL’s long-term viability depends on sustained stakeholder engagement, collaborative leadership, and strategic resource allocation.

<h2 class="center-text">Work-Integrated Learning: Current Shortcomings and Future Quality</h2>

Work-Integrated Learning is a part of experiential learning that blends academic studies with their practical application in a work environment {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. WIL activities include but are not limited to co-op education, fieldwork, internships, applied research projects, hackathons, competitions, and incubators {% cite cewil_what_2021 kay_emerging_2019 %}. Almost half of Ontario’s higher education learners participate in some form of WIL to be better prepared for the workplace {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Research shows that participants in WIL experience superior labour market outcomes, including a higher likelihood of employment and significantly higher incomes {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}. Usher {% cite usher_why_2020 %} claims that WIL is a useful talent scouting opportunity for employers, forging new connections with up-and-coming graduates.

<h3>The Importance of WIL</h3>

<h3>The Importance of WIL in the Graphic Design Program</h3>

<h3>Current State of WIL in Graphic Design</h3>

Collaboration and mentorship are essential to the practice of graphic design and central elements of WIL, yet WIL experiences in the Graphic Design program occur at inconsistent intervals, vary unpredictably in scope, and lack consistency. They do not conform with institutional standards and are not supported with adequate documentation. Inclusion of stakeholder perspectives is non-existent, with faculty engagement predicted to be especially challenging. Furthermore, remote WIL activities deliver fewer opportunities for mentoring. 

The only WIL activity Algonquin College Graphic Design students have experienced in recent years is fieldwork. It is the only experiential learning formally included in the Program of Study {% cite algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_about_nodate %}. There are no in-class industry projects, nor any other form of WIL for five and a half semesters. A student in the Graphic Design program builds their portfolio to eventually apply for fieldwork in their fifth or sixth semester. Before then, they have no interaction with professional graphic designers, aside from their faculty and the occasional portfolio review event. In fact, most students study for five or six semesters before ever setting foot in a graphic design studio. They choose a career for which they have never seen their eventual work environment. The proposed leadership and change management plan aims to formulate an approach to address these issues, thus enabling WIL experiences to deliver the promise of improving student employability and industry readiness. These positive outcomes can only be expected from quality WIL experiences.

<h3>Defining Quality WIL</h3>

Rather than a single metric to assess quality, it must be evaluated from each stakeholder’s perspective, in this context, taking into consideration the degree to which WIL fulfills its stated mission—in other words, its fitness for purpose {% cite bobby_abcs_2014 harvey_defining_1993 %}. Here, stakeholders include students, faculty, employers, and college administration. For a student, quality WIL experiences deliver mentorship, while employers expect well prepared candidates {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016 %}. As they spearhead WIL initiatives, faculty benefit from an updated and expanded professional network, current, industry-relevant skills, and curriculum that is aligned with academic standards {% cite stirling_postsecondary_2017 %} and employers’ expectations {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 yorke_workengaged_2011 %}. McRae et al. affirm that industry participants view WIL as a source of next-generation talent and cutting-edge techniques and trends. By supporting WIL activities, the college benefits from improved recruitment and retention and curriculum alignment with employer needs {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}. These benefits respond directly to the primary mission of an Ontario College of Applied Arts and Technology, supporting economic development and assisting its students in finding employment {% cite noauthor_ontario_2002 %}.

<h2 class="center-text">Leadership and Change Management</h2>

<h3>Addressing Challenges and Barriers</h3>

Considering the sizable workload WIL activities represent, the most important challenge to consistent, high-quality WIL activities in the Graphic Design program is continued stakeholder engagement. To address this, a collaborative approach is useful, where stakeholders share a language, mutual understanding and trust to achieve learning outcomes {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 lauer_change_2021 %}. With this shared understanding, each party recognizes the benefits enjoyed by participating. This builds intrinsic motivation for continued engagement. Absent these robust relationships, distrust can build, resulting in abandonment by some. Creating a strong coalition of stakeholders with clear understanding of the merits of WIL participation ensures ongoing stakeholder engagement. Of the stakeholders, faculty hold a special position as the initiators of WIL activities.

Without continued faculty engagement in WIL activities, its quality and frequency diminish. Stirling {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %} highlights that instructors must educate themselves about their roles as WIL facilitators and design curriculum that connects with workplace practice. This adds to already burdensome workloads, which, if not included in their standard workload formula, is generally met with resistance (Dzingirai, 2020). This lack of recognition is remedied by allocating financial and human resources as a matter of course. This ensures the continuation of WIL activities for the long term, weathering changes in faculty and administrative staff.

Embedding WIL as a learning model in the Program of Study ensures it persists. It also improves quality, notwithstanding institutional changes or budgetary constraints. Institutional recognition of WIL as a learning model in the Graphic Design program contributes to its quality {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 patrick_wil_2008 rosenbaum_planned_2018 %}. With WIL embedded in the program, the college can measure quality through its institutional key performance indicators such as retention graduation, and post-graduation sector-specific employment rates. These results allow stakeholders to respond with adjustments to WIL practice in a continuous improvement process {% cite deming_pdsa_nodate %}. Formalizing the inclusion of WIL in the Graphic Design program bolsters its quality into the future. This demonstrates a commitment by the college to endorse WIL as part of its vision of experiential learning.

<h3>Leading Change</h3>

Leaders must navigate competing tensions, maintain academic quality, and manage both fiscal and human resources in institutions that often have decentralized leadership. To do so, Drew {% cite drew_issues_2010 %} emphasizes the importance of interpersonal engagement, strategic vision, adaptability, and creativity. WIL stakeholders are a diverse group with disparate perspectives. If they are aligned around a shared vision, trust is built, fostering collaboration to overcome resistance and ensure successful change initiatives. Without this approach, leaders risk confusion, resistance, and failure to achieve meaningful transformation.

<h3>Assessing Readiness for Change</h3>

Assessing readiness is an important stage before committing to an organizational change initiative. Change leaders play a crucial role in fostering people’s readiness, which strongly affects their willingness to undertake change {% cite gelaidan_employee_2018 rousseau_evidence-based_2022 %}. Barriers to initiating change need to be identified and addressed before change can proceed. Overworked or stressed individuals are not open to undertaking new responsibilities. A top-down approach imposing change is likely to fail if participants are not included in upfront planning and preparation. Gauging all stakeholders’ readiness to shoulder new responsibilities is an important initial step. Once participants are receptive to being involved in the change process, they need to believe in the value of the objective.

Evidence such as research, organizational data, and personal experience play a crucial role in decision-making. It can be made more meaningful if it is supported by storytelling to persuade stakeholders of the necessity of change. Stories can make problems relatable, capture attention, and inspire action. Once a story has established new perspectives, evidence can play a powerful corroborating role {% cite barends_evidence-based_2014 rousseau_evidence-based_2022 %}. This engages stakeholders emotionally and intellectually, creating a shared vision for change. Storytelling and evidence together foster understanding, commitment and alignment, ensuring a smoother start to the change process. Once participants are working together, they are more willing to take the first steps.

If any single stakeholder is not on board, the whole change process is put at risk. It is crucial that everyone understands the need for change and appreciates the value of the goal state {% cite kotter_leading_2007 %}. Though the stakeholder group is diverse, they each provide expertise, credibility, and enthusiasm. This coalition fosters buy-in, minimizes resistance, and ensures alignment with organizational goals, driving the change process effectively and sustainably.

<h2 class="center-text">Sustaining Engagement</h2>

An inclusive, transparent approach supports sustained engagement. Keeping channels of communication open between stakeholders, while being fair and respectful is crucial for sustaining momentum in organizational change {% cite herman_evidencebased_2017 %}. This approach builds trust. It also reduces resistance by ensuring stakeholders feel heard and valued. Open communication helps clarify the rationale behind changes, alleviating anxiety and fostering engagement. Respectful treatment and fair processes encourage stakeholder participation, leading to more effective and sustainable change. Such practices prevent alienation and enhance motivation, ultimately supporting the success of the change initiative. 

An organizational change initiative cannot happen in a vacuum. It is more likely to proceed with less friction if the organization’s existing ethos, values and norms are understood and integrated into the change process {% cite newton_best_2016 %}. Doing so is crucial because it minimizes resistance. It aligns the change initiative with the organization’s identity. Ignoring these factors can lead to disengagement, as stakeholders may bristle at changes that conflict with the organization’s cultural values.

The Graphic Design program must formalize what quality WIL is and how to maintain by establishing a quality assurance framework tailored for this creative, collaborative field. This ensures that experiences are meaningful, structured, and aligned with program outcomes {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}. This fosters consistence, accountability, and continuous improvement, which directly impacts student outcomes, stakeholder satisfaction, and institutional reputation. It provides a structured process to align WIL experiences with academic goals and industry needs while maintaining quality. Without such a framework, the program risks inconsistency, reduced stakeholder commitment, diminishing the likelihood of long-term success.

<h3>WIL Engagement and Program Success</h3>

Assessing the long-term impact of sustained stakeholder engagement in WIL on program success is not addressed in the literature. Such a framework is important because it provides a structured way to assess how ongoing stakeholder collaboration influences outcomes like program quality, stakeholder satisfaction, and student employability. Filling this gap would allow institutions to identify best practices and improve program success.

<h2 class="center-text">Conclusion</h2>

 This literature review highlights the pivotal role of WIL in bridging academic learning and industry practice. The research underscores WIL’s benefits, including enhanced employability, stakeholder engagement, and academic alignment. However, existing WIL activities in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College lack consistency, documentation, and faculty participation. Addressing these challenges requires a robust leadership and change management strategy.

The proposed plan leverages collaborative leadership, inclusive stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation. Embedding WIL as a formalized learning model within the program ensures sustained quality. Transparent communication and a structured quality assurance framework are crucial to achieving these goals. This approach fosters a culture of continuous improvement, aligning with institutional goals and stakeholder expectations. By adopting this change management strategy, the Graphic Design program can enhance WIL’s impact on student readiness, industry engagement, and program success.
