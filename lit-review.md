<h2 class="center-text">Leading and Managing Change at Algonquin College</h2>

In keeping with the mandate of Ontario’s publicly supported colleges to provide a labour force that's workplace ready {% cite canlii_ontario_2017 %}, the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College has maintained strong relationships with local, sector-specific employers. A key component of the program’s ties to industry is the provision of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL), though its quality and consistency is deteriorating with time. <span class="blue">This paper presents a literature review focused on leading and managing an organizational change process to embed Work-Integrated Learning as a learning model in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. Grounded in the ADKAR change model and Deming’s continuous improvement framework, this review contends that WIL’s long-term viability depends on sustained stakeholder engagement, collaborative leadership, and strategic resource allocation.</span>

The review examines scholarly works published internationally addressing the challenges of implementing sustained, high-quality WIL in higher education, with a focus on leading and managing change. The scope includes peer-reviewed studies published from 1992 to 2024 analyzing stakeholder engagement barriers, and leadership strategies. This review aims to identify evidence-based practices for embedding WIL as a core pedagogical model while addressing faculty workload constraints and inconsistent industry participation.

The analysis has the following structure: the background and context of the problem of practice, the importance of WIL, why embedding it is important, the collaborative leadership approach, integration of ADKAR and PDSA, the approach to stakeholder engagement, and resource allocation.

<span class="blue">[claim statement]</span> Embedding Work-Integrated Learning in Algonquin College's Graphic Design program is essential for enhancing student employability, building a strong industry talent pipeline, and maintaining faculty currency. Achieving this requires a collaborative leadership approach, sustained stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation to align WIL initiatives with institutional objectives, address existing inconsistencies, and ensure the program’s long-term success.

<h2 class="center-text">Background</h2>

### What is WIL?

Though definitions of WIL vary broadly in the literature, Work-Integrated Learning is an educational approach which is a part of experiential learning that integrates academic learning with practical experience in a professional setting. It is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling students to develop industry-relevant skills. WIL can take various forms, including but not limited to co-op programs, internships, apprenticeships, clinical placements, research partnerships, and project-based work. These experiences may be paid or unpaid, required or optional, and can occur at different points within a program of study. They can occur on-campus or off. The defining feature is that it contributes to students’ academic *and* professional development {% cite cewil_what_2021 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

### Why is the Change Needed?

-->

In recent years, WIL's acceptance as a valued learning model has grown, as has its provision in higher education {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}, {% cite jackson_embedding_2021 %}, {% cite smigiel_managing_2015 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}, {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}. WIL is particularly relevant in collaborative fields {% cite tezcan_scaffolded_2020 %}, {% cite smith_impact_2014 %} such as graphic design, where mentorship and professional engagement play pivotal roles in shaping students’ skills and career readiness {% cite cutean_impact_2023 %}, {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite smith_impact_2014 %}.

The Graphic Design program is six semesters long, running in the fall and winter semesters. Despite its importance, WIL is limited to a single fieldwork component in the final semester {% cite  algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_graphic_2024 %}. During five of the six semesters students participate in no WIL activities at all. As for the present state of program-industry relations, the faculty have their own expansive professional networks, but the program itself does little official outreach to the region's employers to communicate the value of WIL. Inclusion of stakeholder perspectives in the curriculum design is almost non-existent. Faculty participation in WIL is minimal.

### The Importance of WIL to Each Stakeholder

Algonquin College recognizes a wide range of WIL typologies, including field projects, applied research projects, learning enterprises, and more {% cite algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_wil_2019 %}, yet there is only one WIL experience at the end of the Graphic Design Program of Study. This insufficient integration fails to meet the demands of both students and industry partners {% cite edwards_integrating_2007 %}. It delivers too little industry contact, too late in students’ education.

#### Importance to Students

Learners benefit from earlier, consistent, high-quality WIL activities with models that are varied and innovative {% cite abeysekera_issues_2006 %}. A properly prepared aspiring graphic designer has WIL experiences of increasing intensity at all stages of their academic journey. They are exposed to theory then practice in a scaffolded structure progressing throughout the academic curriculum {% cite dean_institutional_2020 %}, {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 %}, {% cite jackson_employability_2015 %}, {% cite  mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}, {% cite orrell_good_2011 %}. This model builds momentum, making a smoother transition towards the workplace and future career success {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %} rather than an abrupt intensive experience at the end of their studies.

Additionally, WIL experiences sooner in students' progress through the program support their choice of vocation early-on {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}. Because WIL helps students clarify their career goals, they can use their experiences to determine if their choice of sector or industry is right for them {% cite billett_realising_2009 %}, {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 %}. It also bolsters their résumés with the addition of their WIL position. They can gain contracts in their field of practice, which can help build a professional network {% cite usher_why_2020 %}, {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}, {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2012 %}.

Beyond the disciplinary expertise gained in the course of their regular studies, frequent WIL fosters the timely development of professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving {% cite cutean_impact_2023 %}, {% cite crebert_developing_2004 %}, {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite smith_impact_2014 %}. Finally, WIL plays a central role in supporting the development students' professional identity {% cite trede_role_2012 %}.

In an academic context, students who participate in WIL have a higher GPA than those who do not. They are more satisfied with their programs, are less worried about their studies and experience superior labour market outcomes {% cite drysdale_motivation_2018 %},  {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %},  {% cite macdonald_realizing_2014 %}, {% cite raelin_gendered_2014 %}, {% cite parker_differential_2016 %} {% cite purdie_are_2013 %} {% cite raelin_gendered_2014 %} {% cite ramirez_academic_2015 %}

In an professional context, almost half of Ontario’s higher education learners participate in some form of WIL to be better prepared for the workplace {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Research shows that participants in WIL experience superior labour market outcomes, including a higher likelihood of employment and significantly higher incomes {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

#### Importance to Employers

Employers play a crucial role in WIL initiatives. By participating, they also benefit from several advantages. WIL serves as a pipeline for recruiting skilled graduates who are familiar with industry practices and expectations. It is a useful talent scouting opportunity for employers, forging new connections with up-and-coming graduates {% cite usher_why_2020 %}. Employers report reduced recruitment costs and risks when hiring graduates who have participated in WIL. Students bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas and cutting-edge knowledge to the workplace, contributing to organizational growth and problem-solving. Collaborating with educational institutions fosters long-term relationships that support workforce development {% cite bilgin_impact_2024 %}, {% cite chatoor_working_2023 %},
{% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}, {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}

The region's employers have challenges all their own, financial, workload and staffing constraints being chief among them. Furthermore, they may be faced with more bureaucratic institutional processes than they are used to when dealing with the college. Employers also need to manage student and college expectations as to placement duration, and the type of projects they undertake while at work. Student quality is also an unpredictable factor for employers {% cite clayton_australias_2019 %}, {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}.

#### Importance to the College

Embedding WIL pays dividends to faculty as it does for the institution as a whole. For Algonquin College, incorporating meaningful experiential learning opportunities keeps students engaged academically, reducing dropout rates {% cite billett_realising_2009 %}, {% cite mcbeath_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite parker_differential_2016 %}. A robust WIL program positions the institution as a leader in experiential education, attracting prospective students and industry partners alike {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Embedded WIL supports the college’s commitment to preparing graduates for the workforce while fulfilling its mandate under the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act {% cite canlii_ontario_2017 %}. It is a vehicle for facilitating strong partnerships with industry which lead to better engagement and retention rates {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}.

The college faces the challenge of placing fairly large student cohorts with a finite number of employers in the region. The program is reliant on a limited number of employers that are prepared to host students.

Faculty members also benefit from embedding WIL in the curriculum, principally by enhancing their currency. Engaging with industry partners ensures curriculum remains aligned with current professional practices and trends. Partnering with employers provides faculty with insights into workplace demands, enabling them to design more consequential learning experiences in the classroom. Faculty gain opportunities to expand their networks and stay connected to industry developments, enhancing their teaching effectiveness {% cite abeysekera_issues_2006 %}, {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite vailasseri_embedding_2021 %}.

The workload for faculty facilitating WIL is substantial {% cite clark_power_2016 %}. They often receive insufficient training and recognition for developing and delivering WIL curriculum {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %},  {% cite jackson_work-integrated_2024 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}.

### Embedding for Consistency
<!-- Why Embedding WIL is a Good Thing -->

Embedding WIL as a learning model in the Program of Study ensures it persists. It also improves quality, notwithstanding institutional changes or budgetary constraints {% cite jackson_embedding_2021 %}. Institutional recognition of WIL as a learning model in the Graphic Design program contributes to its quality {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite rosenbaum_planned_2018 %}. With WIL integrated throughout the Program of Study, the college can measure quality through its institutional key performance indicators such as retention, graduation, and post-graduation sector-specific employment rates {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}. These results allow stakeholders to respond with adjustments to WIL practice in a continuous improvement process {% cite deming_pdsa_nodate %}, {% cite bobby_abcs_2014 %}. Formalizing the inclusion of WIL in the Graphic Design program bolsters its quality into the future. This demonstrates a commitment by the college to endorse WIL as part of its vision of experiential learning {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}.

(Add a transition text to launch into the themes.)

<h2 class="center-text">Theme #1: Collaborative Leadership</h2>

“*Excellence occurs in the company of others.*”, Hannah Arendt

Wood and Gray {% cite wood_toward_1991 %} have formulated a definition of collaborative leadership that aligns well with the desired leadership approach for this change process: “Collaboration occurs when a group of autonomous stakeholders of a problem domain engage in an interactive process, using shared rules, norms, and structures to act or decide on issues related to that domain” (p. 143) The central idea of using collaborative leadership is to bring together stakeholders to participate in planning and decision-making, giving input and agency to everyone involved, including students. Collaboration comes with its own intrinsic rewards, like meeting new individuals inside and outside the college, and accomplishing goals an individual alone could not attain {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}.

However, there is a gap between the idealized definition of collaboration by Wood & Gray and experiences in the Graphic Design program. The definition may conflict with the college's bureaucratic structures. If WIL is currently organized in a siloed manner rather than collaboratively, there's a risk that participation is compartmentalized by role, requiring existing leadership models to adapt from a top-down to an egalitarian approach. If all stakeholders share the values of a student-centred, innovative, and egalitarian approach to the change process, collaboration should happen more naturally {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}.

#### Open Communication

References to successful change initiatives in the literature consistently include the importance of communication as foundational to sustaining relationships. Open, honest, transparent communication plays an indispensable role in the proposed collaborative leadership approach. It can take place in person, in written form, as electronic communication, even including social media. When communications address stakeholders' uncertainty, it positively affects their openness to change {% cite peus_leading_2009 %}.

Communication among stakeholders does not only include formal work-related conversations. It also takes the form of casual, collegial chatter. It is often durning these talks that cynicism or resistance surfaces. These negative views risk propagating. To mitigate this risk, change leaders need to recognize those who have positive views of changes share those with others {% cite peus_leading_2009 %} {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}.

Positive, motivating outcomes result from open communications. Take participant recognition and promotion of their reputation as examples. Ongoing, clear communication bolsters the reciprocity of the partnerships in the WIL implementation process, building trust among stakeholders {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. Yet, communications need to be exclusively positive to be constructive. If they are to be truly open, exchanges must also include the sharing of negative information, which may include the poor state of WIL in the program (the rationale for the change itself). This has the effect of immunizing the recipients of the information, reducing uncertainty and anxiety {% cite peus_leading_2009 %}.

The first and most important message to share is the vision for the proposed change {% cite kotter_leading_2007 %}. Having a well articulated vision that is clearly communicated brings stakeholders together with a clear understanding of each others' expectations {% cite cooper_university_2016 %}, {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. Re-articulating the vision on a regular basis helps keep everyone on track {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}. Likewise, dissemination of WIL best practices to all stakeholders promotes their use {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}.

Leading this change process requires moving beyond simply describing communication practices. They're not simply a tactic. They are the infrastructure of the change process. They need to address institutional realities and human behaviours. Adopting a multi-level messaging approach which ranges from broadcast using digital newsletters and LMS announcements, to peer-to-peer dialogue using Slack or Teams mitigates cynicism and formalizes best practices into policy.

### Co-Design with Students

-   {% cite de_oliveira_how_2023 %}: has a definition and more benefits of collaborative leadership.
-   Case studies from Queensland University of Technology’s Design Futures initiative demonstrate that co-governed WIL committees—comprising 40% industry representatives, 30% faculty, 20% students, and 10% administrators—increase partnership longevity by 63% compared to top-down models."

### Build a Guiding Coalition

Collaborative leadership serves as the foundation for driving this change initiative. The approach involves forming a guiding coalition, a WIL team, consisting of faculty members, upper-level students capable of articulating experiential learning needs, industry partners invested in talent pipeline development, and college administrators to address institutional barriers. This coalition is composed of individuals with enough authority and influence to lead the change process. They spur stakeholders to work together, to implement needed strategies, and to oversee them during implementation {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}.

Kotter's research emphasizes that transformative change cannot be driven solely in a top-down manner. It requires an inclusive team with authority, expertise, and credibility. The coalition's effectiveness hinges on members' perceived legitimacy across stakeholder groups {% cite kotter_leading_2007 %}.

Initial resistance to expanded WIL responsibilities requires the coalition to use evidence-based persuasion techniques. For instance, by comparing WIL's higher graduate employment rates {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %} with current student knowledge gaps, the coalition can create an analytical and an emotional appeal {% cite kotter_leading_2012 %}.

<!-- 
The team holds strategic planning sessions to explore and identify roles and responsibilities of each team member. A vision is formulated, including strategic goals of the team, that are aligned with the end state of embedded WIL in the Graphic Design program curriculum {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016  %}.

A collaborative approach is useful, where stakeholders share a language, mutual understanding and trust to achieve learning outcomes {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %} {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %} {% cite lauer_change_2021 %}.

Employers play a central role in assessing student success while learning in the workplace. Consequently, employers and faculty need to employ a collaborative approach to ensure students have attained requisite learning outcomes through a rigorous, coordinated assessment process {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %}
 -->

#### Storytelling

Storytelling makes individuals' realities meaning. It can motivate and engage stakeholders. The benefit of storytelling in bolstering engagement is that it does not require expert knowledge. {% cite sundin_rethinking_2018 %}.

### Fostering Readiness for Change 

Then fostering their readiness to undertake the change initiative {% cite chappell_exploring_2016 %}, {% cite conner_committing_1992 %}, {% cite drew_issues_2010 %}, {% cite gelaidan_employee_2018 %}, {% cite janich_facilitator_2016 %}, {% cite radwan_lead_2020 %}. With this shared understanding, each party recognizes the benefits enjoyed by participating {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. This builds intrinsic motivation for continued engagement. Absent these robust relationships, distrust can build, resulting in abandonment by some. Creating a strong coalition of stakeholders with clear understanding of the merits of WIL participation ensures ongoing stakeholder engagement. Of the stakeholders, faculty hold a special position as the initiators of WIL activities.

### Challenges

Without continued faculty engagement in WIL activities, its quality and frequency diminish. Stirling {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %} highlights that instructors must educate themselves about their roles as WIL facilitators and design curriculum that connects with workplace practice. This adds to already burdensome workloads, which, if not included in their standard workload formula, is generally met with resistance {% cite sony_barriers_2020 %}. This lack of recognition is remedied by allocating financial and human resources as a matter of course. This ensures the continuation of WIL activities for the long term, weathering changes in faculty and administrative staff.

### Integration of ADKAR & Deming

Integrating the Prosci ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) model with Deming's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle creates a powerful framework for implementing and sustaining the WIL initiative in the program. The two approaches complement each other, with ADKAR providing a people-centred change leadership approach, and Deming's PDSA cycle offering the continuous improvement process.

The Plan phase incorporate ADKAR's Awareness and Desire elements to ensure stakeholders understand why change is needed and want to participate. The Do phase applies ADKAR's Knowledge and Ability components to ensure people have the information and skills needed to implement the planned changes. The Study phase evaluates both process outcomes and individual adoption, identifying barriers in each individual's change journey. Finally, the Act Phase uses ADKAR's Reinforcement strategies to sustain changes while making necessary adjustments to the overall approach.

<h2 class="center-text">Theme #2: Sustained, Inclusive Stakeholder Engagement</h2>

...

Compatibility, commitment, and communications are critical success factors for sustainable relationships {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}.

Employers are unlikely to host a student if their experience is not a positive one. Likewise, the college is not going to partner with an employer that has not offered a quality learning environment. This is an issue of compatibility. {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}.

This can include communications platforms allowing stakeholders to communicate with as little friction as possible. It's about integrating infrastructures between stakeholders.
