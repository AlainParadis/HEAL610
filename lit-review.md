# Leading and Managing Change at Algonquin College

In keeping with the mandate of Ontario’s publicly supported colleges to provide a labour force that's workplace ready {% cite canlii_ontario_2017 %}, the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College has maintained strong relationships with local, sector-specific employers. A key component of the program’s ties to industry is the provision of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL), though its quality and consistency is deteriorating with time, implementing WIL in a "too little, too late" approach. <span class="blue">This paper presents a literature review focused on leading and managing an organizational change process to embed Work-Integrated Learning as a learning model in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. Grounded in Deming’s Plan-Do-Study-Act continuous improvement framework, this review contends that WIL’s long-term viability depends on sustained stakeholder engagement and collaborative leadership.</span>

The review examines scholarly works published internationally addressing the challenges of implementing sustained, high-quality WIL in higher education, with a focus on leading and managing change. The scope includes peer-reviewed studies published from 1992 to 2024 analyzing stakeholder engagement barriers, and leadership strategies. There is an emphasis on Canadian content, accompanied by many sources from Australia. This review aims to identify evidence-based practices for embedding WIL as a core pedagogical model while addressing faculty workload constraints and inconsistent industry participation.

The analysis has the following structure: the background and context of the problem of practice; the importance of WIL; why embedding it is important; the collaborative leadership approach; sustained, inclusive stakeholder engagement; discussion and conclusion.

<div class="blue">Embedding Work-Integrated Learning in Algonquin College's Graphic Design program is essential for enhancing student employability, building a strong industry talent pipeline, and maintaining faculty currency. Achieving this requires a collaborative leadership approach and sustained stakeholder engagement to align WIL initiatives with institutional objectives, address existing inconsistencies, and ensure the program’s long-term success.</div>

## Background

### What is WIL?

Though definitions of WIL vary broadly in the literature, Work-Integrated Learning is an educational approach which is a part of experiential learning that integrates academic learning with practical experience in a professional setting. It is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling students to develop industry-relevant skills. WIL can take various forms, including but not limited to co-op programs, internships, apprenticeships, clinical placements, research partnerships, and project-based work. These experiences may be paid or unpaid, required or optional, and can occur at different points within a program of study. They can occur on-campus or off. The defining feature is that it contributes to students’ academic *and* professional development {% cite cewil_what_2021 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

### Why is the Change Needed?

In recent years, WIL's acceptance as a valued learning model has grown, as has its provision in higher education {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}, {% cite jackson_embedding_2021 %}, {% cite smigiel_managing_2015 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}, {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}. WIL is particularly relevant in collaborative fields {% cite tezcan_scaffolded_2020 %}, {% cite smith_impact_2014 %} such as graphic design, where mentorship and professional engagement play pivotal roles in shaping students’ skills and career readiness {% cite cutean_impact_2023 %}, {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite smith_impact_2014 %}. Here, Deming's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle offers a structured approach to phased WIL integration across semesters. The Plan phase maps workplace skill development against existing curriculum. The Do stage implements in-class industry projects before scaling to full fieldwork in third year. This aligns with evidence that scaffolded WIL yields higher graduation rates compared to the current single-fieldwork model {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

Despite its importance, WIL is limited to a single fieldwork component in the final semester {% cite  algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_graphic_2024 %}, which is a "too little, too late" approach. The Graphic Design program is six semesters long, running in the fall and winter semesters. During five of the six semesters students participate in no WIL activities at all. As for the present state of program-industry relations, the faculty have their own expansive professional networks, but the program itself does little official outreach to the region's employers to communicate the value of WIL. Inclusion of stakeholder perspectives in the curriculum design is almost non-existent. Faculty participation in WIL is minimal.

### The Importance of WIL to Each Stakeholder

Algonquin College recognizes a wide range of WIL typologies, including field projects, applied research projects, learning enterprises, and more {% cite algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_wil_2019 %}, yet there is only one WIL experience at the end of the Graphic Design Program of Study. This insufficient integration fails to meet the demands of both students and industry partners {% cite edwards_integrating_2007 %}. It delivers too little industry contact, too late in students’ education. The following highlights the importance of embedded WIL to the three key stakeholders, who are students, employers and the college {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}.

#### Importance to Students

Research overwhelmingly demonstrates that WIL participation correlates with improved academic performance, with students earning higher grades than non-participants {% cite drysdale_motivation_2018 %} {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %} {% cite macdonald_realizing_2014 %}. They are more satisfied with their programs, are less worried about their studies and experience superior labour market outcomes {% cite drysdale_motivation_2018 %}, {% cite macdonald_realizing_2014 %}, {% cite raelin_gendered_2014 %}, {% cite parker_differential_2016 %}, {% cite purdie_are_2013 %}, {% cite raelin_gendered_2014 %}, {% cite ramirez_academic_2015 %}, including a higher likelihood of employment and higher incomes {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

However, these outcomes are not the result of a single, isolated fieldwork experience. The literature states that sustained benefits emerge only when WIL is scaffolded across the curriculum through collaborative industry partnerships {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %} and supported by faculty to bridge the academic-industry divide {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. For example, graduates with scaffolded WIL experiences report higher employment rates compared to single-placement peers {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}. This suggests that early, scaffolded exposure mitigates the "too little, too late" problem in the Graphic Design program. This model builds momentum, making a smoother transition towards the workplace and future career success {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %} rather than an abrupt intensive experience at the end of their studies.

Additionally, the literature states that WIL experiences sooner in students' progress through the program support their choice of vocation early-on {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}. This challenges the assumption that career decisions are best left in their final year of study. This evidence supports two elements of the claim statement. Collaborative curriculum design enables scaffolded WIL, where students can test industry fit through projects co-created with industry partners {% cite billett_realising_2009 %}, {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 %}, {% cite zegwaard_routledge_2023 %}. It also supports more informed specialization choices within the field of graphic design. Networking opportunities from scaffolded WIL yield tangible benefits, with participants securing freelance contracts or referrals through employer connections {% cite usher_why_2020 %}, {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2012 %}.

Finally, WIL plays a central role in supporting the development of multiple facets of students' professional identity  {% cite trede_role_2012 %}. Frequent WIL fosters the timely development of professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving {% cite cutean_impact_2023 %}, {% cite crebert_developing_2004 %}, {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite smith_impact_2014 %}. This important identity development would otherwise be neglected in the course of disciplinary studies, further supporting the case for embedded WIL in the Graphic Design program.

#### Importance to Employers

Employers are central stakeholders in WIL initiatives {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. They are also key contributors to and beneficiaries of embedded WIL activities, as articulated in the claim statement. The literature acknowledges that WIL serves as a pipeline for recruiting skilled graduates who are familiar with industry practices and expectations. There is general agreement that it is a useful talent scouting tool for employers, forging new connections with up-and-coming graduates {% cite carmichael_curriculum-aligned_2018 %}, {% cite jackson_work-integrated_2024 %}, {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite usher_why_2020 %}. In numerous studies, employers report reduced recruitment costs and risks when hiring graduates who have participated in WIL. Students bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas and cutting-edge knowledge to the workplace, contributing to organizational growth and problem-solving. Collaborating with educational institutions fosters long-term relationships that support workforce development {% cite bilgin_impact_2024 %}, {% cite chatoor_working_2023 %},
{% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}, {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. An organizational change initiative is more likely to proceed with less friction if the organization’s existing ethos, values and norms are understood and integrated into the change process {% cite mueller_best_2016 %}.

Though the region's employers have challenges all their own; financial, workload and staffing constraints being chief among them. Furthermore, they may be faced with more bureaucratic, inflexible and time-consuming institutional processes than they are used to when dealing with the college. The Graphic Design program is primarily concerned with the curriculum rather than relevance to practice. The college also has its own culture and language which may not be particularly intelligible to an outsider {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016 %} Employers also need to manage student and college expectations as to placement duration, and the type of projects they undertake while at work. Student quality is also an unpredictable factor for employers {% cite clayton_australias_2019 %}, {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}.

#### Importance to the College

There is general consensus in the literature that embedding WIL pays dividends to faculty as it does for the institution as a whole. For Algonquin College, incorporating meaningful experiential learning opportunities keeps students engaged academically, reducing dropout rates {% cite billett_realising_2009 %}, {% cite mcbeath_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite parker_differential_2016 %}. A robust WIL program positions the institution as a leader in experiential education, attracting prospective students and industry partners alike {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Embedded WIL supports the college’s commitment to preparing graduates for the workforce while fulfilling its mandate under the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act {% cite canlii_ontario_2017 %}. It is a vehicle for facilitating strong partnerships with industry which lead to better engagement and retention rates {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}. Though in the National Capital Region, the college faces the challenge of placing fairly large student cohorts with a finite number of employers. The program is reliant on a limited number of employers that are prepared to host students.

Faculty members also benefit from embedding WIL in the curriculum, principally by enhancing their currency. Engaging with industry partners ensures curriculum remains aligned with current professional practices and trends. Partnering with employers provides faculty with insights into workplace demands, enabling them to design more consequential learning experiences in the classroom. Faculty gain opportunities to expand their networks and stay connected to industry developments, enhancing their teaching effectiveness {% cite abeysekera_issues_2006 %}, {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite vailasseri_embedding_2021 %}.

In this case, PDSA's iterative cycle enables continuous faculty development through the Study phase's analysis of industry trends against the current curriculum. The Act phase brings adjustments to curriculum renewal allocations. Here, PDSA feedback loops increase faculty currency and improve curriculum alignment {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}.

The reality on the ground is that the workload for faculty facilitating WIL is substantial and is often met with resistance {% cite clark_power_2016 %} {% cite sony_barriers_2020 %}. Stirling {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %} highlights that instructors must educate themselves about their roles as WIL facilitators and design curriculum that connects with workplace practice. They often receive insufficient training and recognition for this additional work {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite jackson_work-integrated_2024 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}.

In the literature, the principal argument against WIL is that it focuses too heavily on employability, on responding to industry needs, and on the activity itself rather than pedagogy and academic rigour. There are important questions that need addressing. Does the curriculum in the program align with the activities experienced during WIL? Does knowledge from the classroom transfer to the workplace? Is there sufficient reflection on the students' part to internalize what was learned during WIL {% cite orrell_good_2011 %}? {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite thornton_moore_forms_2010 %} These issues need addressing and resolution in the process of embedding WIL in the Graphic Design program.

### Embedding for Consistency

Embedding WIL as a learning model in the Program of Study ensures it persists. It also improves quality, notwithstanding institutional changes or budgetary constraints {% cite jackson_embedding_2021 %}. Institutional recognition of WIL as a learning model in the Graphic Design program contributes to its quality {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite rosenbaum_planned_2018 %}. With WIL integrated throughout the Program of Study, the college can measure quality through its institutional key performance indicators such as retention, graduation, and post-graduation sector-specific employment rates {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}. These results allow stakeholders to respond with adjustments to WIL practice in a continuous improvement process {% cite deming_pdsa_nodate %}, {% cite bobby_abcs_2014 %}. Formalizing the inclusion of WIL in the Graphic Design program bolsters its quality into the future. Embedding PDSA into program review cycles creates institutional memory for quality control. The Plan stage checks WIL KPIs against college priorities; while the Do stage implements scaffolded WIL activities. The Act phase adjusts faculty-employer strategies annually. This approach ensures the continuous improvement {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %} of WIL in the Graphic Design program.

Embedding WIL in the program comes with certain risks that can be mitigated by PDSA's incremental approach. Small-scale Do phases test employer capacity before fully rolling out larger scale WIL activities. Likewise, participating in entry-level design projects alongside professional graphic designers can reduce early-level student trepidation. The Study phase identifies faculty workload issues early. The Act phase institutionalizes support structures for all stakeholders, reducing the risk of disengagement or burnout. Proving return-on-investment data to secure ongoing institutional support needs to be addressed {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite jackson_work-integrated_2024 %}.

#### An Iterative Approach to Change

By addressing collaborative leadership and inclusive partnership models, this review demonstrates how scaffolded WIL experiences enhance student employability while responding to industry needs, and supporting faculty development when tested at a small-scale, then scaling successful activities to minimize disruptions. It shows that embedding WIL as a learning model in the Graphic Design program represents a critical strategy for aligning educational outcomes with industry demands.

## Theme #1: Collaborative Leadership

“*Excellence occurs in the company of others.*”, Hannah Arendt

Wood and Gray {% cite wood_toward_1991 %} have formulated a definition of collaborative leadership that aligns well with the desired leadership approach for this change process: “Collaboration occurs when a group of autonomous stakeholders of a problem domain engage in an interactive process, using shared rules, norms, and structures to act or decide on issues related to that domain” (p. 143) The motivator for using collaborative leadership for this change initiative is to bring together stakeholders to participate in planning and decision-making, giving input and agency to everyone involved, including students. Collaboration comes with its own intrinsic rewards, like meeting new individuals inside and outside the college, and accomplishing goals an individual alone could not attain {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}.

However, there is a gap between the idealized definition of collaboration by Wood & Gray and experiences in the Graphic Design program. The definition may conflict with the college's bureaucratic structures. If WIL is currently organized in a siloed manner rather than collaboratively, there's a risk that participation is compartmentalized by role, requiring existing leadership models to adapt from a top-down to an egalitarian approach. If all stakeholders share the values of a student-centred, innovative, and egalitarian approach to the change process, collaboration should happen more naturally {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}.

#### Open Communication

References to successful change initiatives in the literature consistently include the importance of communication as foundational to sustaining relationships. Open, honest, transparent communication plays an indispensable role in the proposed collaborative leadership approach. It can take place in person, in written form, as electronic communication, even including social media. When communications address stakeholders' uncertainty, it positively affects their openness to change {% cite peus_leading_2009 %}. Communication among stakeholders does not only include formal work-related conversations. It also takes the form of casual, collegial chatter. It is often during these talks that cynicism or resistance surfaces. These negative views risk propagating. To mitigate this risk, change leaders need to recognize those who have positive views of changes share those with others {% cite peus_leading_2009 %} {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}.

Evidence suggests that positive, motivating outcomes result from open communications. Take participant recognition and promotion of their reputation as examples. Ongoing, clear communication bolsters the reciprocity of the partnerships in the WIL implementation process, building trust among stakeholders {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. Yet, communications need not be exclusively positive to be constructive. If they are to be truly open, exchanges must also include the sharing of negative information, which may include the poor state of WIL in the program, the rationale for the change itself. This has the effect of immunizing the recipients of the information, reducing uncertainty and anxiety {% cite peus_leading_2009 %}.

Scholars emphasize that sharing a well articulated vision at the outset of a change initiative brings stakeholders together with a clear understanding of each others' expectations {% cite kotter_leading_2007 %}, {% cite cooper_university_2016 %}, {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. Re-iterating the vision and disseminating WIL best practices on a regular basis helps keep everyone focused and promotes their use {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}, {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}. This suggests that leading this change process requires moving beyond simply describing communication practices. They are not simply a tactic. They are the infrastructure of the change process. They need to address institutional realities and human behaviours. 

### Build a WIL Leadership Team

Collaborative leadership serves as the foundation for driving this change initiative. The approach involves forming a WIL leadership team, consisting of faculty members, upper-level students capable of articulating experiential learning needs, industry partners invested in talent pipeline development, and college administrators to address institutional barriers. These participants have sufficient authority and influence to lead the change process. They spur stakeholders to work together, to implement needed strategies, and to oversee them during implementation {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}, {% cite wood_toward_1991 %}. Research emphasizes that transformative change should not be driven solely in a top-down manner {% cite kang_guiding_2022 %}. It requires an inclusive team with authority, expertise, and credibility. The coalition's effectiveness hinges on members' perceived legitimacy across stakeholder groups {% cite kotter_leading_2007 %}.

Here, the PDSA cycle provides natural checkpoints for coalition guidance. The Plan phase brings together faculty, students, employers, and administrators to identify gaps in the current WIL provision. During the Do phase, the coalition oversees implementation of small-scale WIL pilots before full-scale deployment with each member assigned clear roles to avoid confusion and conflict. Next, members analyze data on WIL experiences from all stakeholders in the Study phase. This ensures that less influential stakeholders' perspectives are included in the analysis. Finally, the coalition uses the data to refine WIL activities, and even their own composition to address emerging needs.

## Theme #2: Sustained, Inclusive Stakeholder Engagement

Embedding WIL in the Graphic Design program requires sustained, inclusive engagement with stakeholders to align the curriculum with industry practice. Research underscores that a collaborative approach, which prioritizes open communication and shared decision-making, are critical for overcoming barriers to effective WIL implementation {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %}, {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %}, {% cite ruskin_engaging_2021 %}. Compatibility, commitment, and communications are critical success factors for sustainable relationships {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. Conversely, inconsistent communication undermines employer participation in WIL {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %} {% cite ferns_enhancing_2016 %}. Recurring points of contact, such as bi-annual Program Advisory Meetings or frequent digital communications foster trust and transparency {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %}.

Sustained engagement ensures that WIL initiatives evolve beyond ad hoc activities to integrated parts of the curriculum. It relies on embedding WIL into the program's yearly workflows, such as faculty assignments and workload allocations, and program quality reviews. Dedicated WIL coordinators integrated in the faculty can maintain stakeholder relationships and align activities with curriculum {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}. From the employers' perspective part of engaging as WIL participants is to prepare their staff to be educators in the workplace {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %}.

Ongoing engagement also ensures that stakeholder input informs ever-evolving curriculum based on industry trends. Such collaboration prevents misalignment between curriculum and employer expectations, a common issue in WIL programs {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. A practical example of such engagement could be iterative workshops where industry professionals critique student portfolios, faculty adjust assessment criteria, and students share their perceptions of skill gaps.

An inclusive approach to engagement has all stakeholders co-creating WIL experiences {% cite carmichael_curriculum-aligned_2018 %}, {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 %}. Aligning expectations requires participants to build trust and a shared vision through transparent communication {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. Inclusive engagement has students as co-creators rather than passive recipients of the curriculum. This fosters ownership of their learning and bridges the gap between school assignments and professional projects {% cite ruskin_engaging_2021 %}. Furthermore, respectful treatment and fair processes encourage stakeholder participation, leading to more effective and sustainable change. Such practices prevent alienation and enhance motivation, ultimately supporting the success of the change initiative {% cite herman_evidencebased_2017 %}.

For WIL engagement to be effective, it must be beneficial to all participants {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}. Employers are unlikely to host a student if their experience is not a positive one. Likewise, the college is not going to partner with an employer that has not offered a quality learning environment. This is an issue of compatibility. {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}.

#### EDI in WIL

Multiple studies document concerning patterns of underrepresentation and inequitable experiences. Gender-based disparities are particularly pronounced. Students with disabilities face barriers throughout the WIL process {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}, from application to workplace integration, where they are more likely to feel ignored {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}. Similarly, immigrant students encounter significantly more obstacles at every stage, being  more likely to experience barriers during placements {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}.

Research demonstrates that removing structural barriers significantly improves access. For example, eliminating GPA requirements for students with disabilities, since there is very little association between Grade Point Averages and WIL success {% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}. In this scenario, PDSA enables evidence-based equity measures. First, EDI benchmarks are set. An activity such as an anonymized portfolio review is held, followed by a comparison of placement rates across demographic groups. Then, support strategies are be scaled across the program's WIL activities. Effective strategies include personalized coaching, specialized pre-employment training focused on self-advocacy and disclosure strategies, and flexible work structures {% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}. Additionally, engaging industry partners in equity discussions and developing formal EDI policies rather than case-by-case approaches is essential for creating inclusive workplace environments {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}.

The evidence suggests that truly inclusive WIL requires removing arbitrary requirements, providing specialized support throughout the WIL process, engaging industry partners in creating inclusive workplaces, and advocating for policy reforms to expand eligibility criteria for government funding programs {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}{% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}.

## Discussion

This literature review reveals several interconnected themes that support the implementation of WIL in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. The evidence consistently demonstrates that WIL initiatives enhance student employability by bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application. However, this relationship is more complex and nuanced. While studies show positive outcomes, they frequently focus on immediate employment rather than future career sustainability. Furthermore, they do not address students' adaptability to changing industry demands over a longer period of time.

The literature emphasizes stakeholder collaboration as essential for successful WIL implementation, yet there appears to be an imbalance in how different stakeholders' needs are prioritized. Industry partners' requirements often take precedence over educational objectives, potentially creating tension between commercial expectations and pedagogical goals. This raises questions about how to maintain academic integrity while satisfying industry demands.

The evidence supporting faculty currency through industry engagement presents a somewhat idealized view. The practical challenges of maintaining teaching responsibilities while fostering industry connections are underrepresented, suggesting a need for more realistic models of faculty professional development that acknowledge time and resource constraints.

## Conclusion

The literature reviewed provides compelling evidence supporting the implementation of a comprehensive Work-Integrated Learning framework within Algonquin College's Graphic Design program. This evidence-based approach to change management reveals several key insights that directly inform the proposed transformation.

The research consistently demonstrates that WIL initiatives significantly enhance student employability by developing essential professional competencies that extend beyond technical skills. Students engaged in authentic workplace experiences develop the communication abilities, problem-solving approaches, and collaborative mindsets that employers consistently identify as critical attributes for success in the design industry. This alignment between educational outcomes and industry needs creates a powerful rationale for embedding WIL as a core component of the curriculum rather than an optional add-on.

The evidence further supports the assertion that a collaborative leadership approach is essential for successful WIL implementation. Studies examining effective WIL programs highlight the importance of distributed leadership models that engage stakeholders at all levels—from institutional administration to program faculty to industry partners. This collaborative approach creates the shared ownership necessary to sustain WIL initiatives beyond initial implementation, addressing the challenge of inconsistent application that has hindered previous efforts.

Faculty currency emerges as both a beneficiary of and contributor to successful WIL programs. The literature demonstrates that faculty who maintain active industry connections through WIL supervision and partnership development remain current with evolving professional practices, enhancing their instructional effectiveness. This creates a positive feedback loop where faculty currency strengthens WIL experiences, which in turn further enhances faculty professional development.

Perhaps most significantly, the research validates the importance of systematic stakeholder engagement in creating sustainable WIL programs. Successful models consistently feature structured approaches to identifying, engaging, and maintaining relationships with industry partners, creating clear value propositions for all participants. This evidence directly informs the proposed change management approach, which prioritizes relationship-building and stakeholder communication as foundational elements.

The literature also acknowledges the challenges inherent in WIL implementation, particularly regarding resource allocation, assessment standardization, and balancing competing priorities. By recognizing these potential barriers, the proposed change management plan incorporates strategies to address them proactively, including phased implementation, regular evaluation cycles, and dedicated coordination resources.

In conclusion, the evidence reviewed provides a robust foundation for embedding WIL in Algonquin College's Graphic Design program through a collaborative leadership approach. By aligning with institutional objectives, addressing existing inconsistencies, and ensuring sustained stakeholder engagement, this evidence-based change initiative promises to enhance student employability, strengthen industry partnerships, and maintain faculty currency—ultimately securing the program's long-term success in an evolving educational and professional landscape.
