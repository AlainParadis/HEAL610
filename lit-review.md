<h2 class="center-text">Leading and Managing Change at Algonquin College</h2>

In keeping with the mandate of Ontario’s publicly supported colleges to provide a labour force that's workplace ready {% cite canlii_ontario_2017 %}, the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College has maintained strong relationships with local, sector-specific employers. A key component of the program’s ties to industry is the provision of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL), though its quality and consistency is deteriorating with time. <span class="blue">This paper presents a literature review focused on leading and managing an organizational change process to embed Work-Integrated Learning as a learning model in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. Grounded in Kotter’s change management theory and Deming’s continuous improvement framework, this review contends that WIL’s long-term viability depends on sustained stakeholder engagement, collaborative leadership, and strategic resource allocation.</span>

The review examines scholarly works published internationally addressing the challenges of implementing sustained, high-quality WIL in higher education, with a focus on leading and managing change. The scope includes peer-reviewed studies published from 1992 to 2024 analyzing stakeholder engagement barriers, and leadership strategies. This review aims to identify evidence-based practices for embedding WIL as a core pedagogical model while addressing faculty workload constraints and inconsistent industry participation.

The analysis has the following structure: the background and context of the problem of practice, current deficiencies in WIL delivery leadership approaches, and mechanisms for sustaining engagement (...).

<span class="blue">[claim statement]</span> Embedding Work-Integrated Learning in Algonquin College's Graphic Design program is essential for enhancing student employability, building a strong industry talent pipeline, and maintaining faculty currency. Achieving this requires a collaborative leadership approach, sustained stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation to align WIL initiatives with institutional objectives, address existing inconsistencies, and ensure the program’s long-term success.

### What is WIL?

Work-Integrated Learning is an educational approach which is a part of experiential learning that integrates academic learning with practical experience in a professional setting. It is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling students to develop industry-relevant skills. WIL can take various forms, including but not limited to co-op programs, internships, apprenticeships, clinical placements, research partnerships, and project-based work. These experiences may be paid or unpaid, required or optional, and can occur at different points within a program of study. They can occur on-campus or off. The defining feature is that it contributes to students’ academic *and* professional development {% cite cewil_what_2021 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

### Why is the Change Needed?

In recent years, WIL's acceptance as a valued learning model has grown, as has its provision in higher education {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}, {% cite smigiel_managing_2015 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}, {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}. In the Graphic Design program, WIL is particularly relevant due to the collaborative nature of the field, where mentorship and professional engagement play pivotal roles in shaping students’ skills and career readiness {% cite cutean_impact_2023 mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}. The Graphic Design program is six semesters long, running in the fall and winter semesters. Yet, despite its importance, WIL is limited to a single fieldwork component in the final semester {% cite  algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_graphic_2024 %}. During five of the six semesters students participate in no WIL activities.

### The Importance of WIL to Each Stakeholder

This insufficient integration fails to meet the demands of both students and industry partners. Algonquin College recognizes a wide range of WIL typologies, including field projects, applied research projects, learning enterprises, and more {% cite algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_wil_2019 %}, yet there is only one WIL experience at the end of the Program of Study. This delivers too little industry contact, too late in students’ education.

#### Importance to Students

Learners benefit from earlier, consistent, high-quality WIL activities with models that are varied and innovative. A properly prepared aspiring graphic designer has WIL experiences of increasing intensity at all stages of their academic journey. They are exposed to theory then practice in a scaffolded structure progressing throughout the academic curriculum. {% cite  mabungela_accelerating_2024 %} {% cite orrell_good_2011 %} {% cite dean_institutional_2020 %} {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}. This model builds momentum, making a smoother transition towards the workplace and future career success {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite kay_emerging_2019 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}, {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %} rather than an abrupt intensive experience at the end of their studies.

Additionally, WIL experiences sooner in students' progress through the program support their choice of vocation early-on {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}, {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %}. Because WIL helps students clarify their career goals, they can use their experiences to determine if their choice of sector or industry is right for them. It also bolsters their résumés with the addition of their WIL position. They can gain contracts in their field of practice, which can help build a professional network {% cite usher_why_2020 %} {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}, {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite ross_developing_2019 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2012 %}.

Beyond the disciplinary expertise gained in the course of their regular studies, frequent WIL fosters the timely development of professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving {% cite cutean_impact_2023 %}, {% cite crebert_developing_2004 %}, {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}. Finally, WIL plays a central role in supporting the development students' professional identity {% cite trede_role_2012 %}.

In the academic context, students who participate in WIL have a higher GPA than those who do not. They are more satisfied with their programs, are less worried about their studies and experience superior labour market outcomes {% cite drysdale_motivation_2018 jackson_impact_2023 macdonald_realizing_2014 raelin_gendered_2014 parker_differential_2016 purdie_are_2013 raelin_gendered_2014 ramirez_academic_2015 %}

In the professional context, almost half of Ontario’s higher education learners participate in some form of WIL to be better prepared for the workplace {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Research shows that participants in WIL experience superior labour market outcomes, including a higher likelihood of employment and significantly higher incomes {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %} {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}.

#### Importance to Employers

Employers play a crucial role in WIL initiatives, benefiting from several advantages. WIL serves as a pipeline for recruiting skilled graduates who are familiar with industry practices and expectations. It is a useful talent scouting opportunity for employers, forging new connections with up-and-coming graduates {% cite usher_why_2020 %}. Employers report reduced recruitment costs and risks when hiring graduates who have participated in WIL. Students bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas and cutting-edge knowledge to the workplace, contributing to organizational growth and problem-solving. Collaborating with educational institutions fosters long-term relationships that support workforce development {% cite bilgin_impact_2024 %}, {% cite chatoor_working_2023 %},
{% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %}, {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}, {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}, {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}

#### Importance to the College

-   {% cite abeysekera_issues_2006 %}: Benefits to faculty
-   Incorporating meaningful experiential learning opportunities keeps students engaged academically, reducing dropout rates {% cite mabungela_accelerating_2024 %}.
-   A robust WIL program positions Algonquin College as a leader in experiential education, attracting prospective students and industry partners alike {% cite sachs_2017_2017 %} {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}.
-   Embedding WIL supports the college’s commitment to preparing graduates for the workforce while fulfilling its mandate under the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act {% cite canlii_ontario_2017 %}.
-   Faculty currency and network building {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}, {% cite provosts_task_force_on_experiential_education_experiential_2017 %}, {% cite vailasseri_embedding_2021 %}
-    WIL attracts prospective students. It is a vehicle for facilitating strong partnerships with industry which lead to better engagement and retention rates {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %} {% cite patrick_wil_2008 %}.
-   Faculty members also benefit from embedding WIL in the curriculum. Engaging with industry partners ensures curriculum remains aligned with current professional practices and trends. Partnering with employers also provides faculty with insights into workplace demands, enabling them to design more consequential learning experiences in the classroom. Faculty gain opportunities to expand their networks and stay connected to industry developments, enhancing their teaching effectiveness {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}.

### Why Embedding WIL is a Good Thing

Embedding WIL as a learning model in the Program of Study ensures it persists. It also improves quality, notwithstanding institutional changes or budgetary constraints. Institutional recognition of WIL as a learning model in the Graphic Design program contributes to its quality {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 patrick_wil_2008 rosenbaum_planned_2018 %}. With WIL embedded in the program, the college can measure quality through its institutional key performance indicators such as retention graduation, and post-graduation sector-specific employment rates. These results allow stakeholders to respond with adjustments to WIL practice in a continuous improvement process {% cite deming_pdsa_nodate bobby_abcs_2014 %}. Formalizing the inclusion of WIL in the Graphic Design program bolsters its quality into the future. This demonstrates a commitment by the college to endorse WIL as part of its vision of experiential learning.

### Challenges

Despite the many benefits WIL brings to the college and to the region's graphic design employers, these stakeholders do face challenges in doing so. The administrative burden can be a heavy one for the program and the department, as is the workload for faculty facilitating WIL {% cite clark_power_2016 %}. They often receive insufficient training and recognition for developing and delivering WIL curriculum {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 %},  {% cite jackson_work-integrated_2024 %}, {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}.

Both institutions and organizations participating in WIL need to navigate fluctuations in supply and demand of opportunities. The region's employers have challenges all their own, financial, workload and staffing constraints being chief among them. Furthermore, they may be faced with more institutional processes (bureaucracy) than they're used to when dealing with the college. Employers also need to manage student and college expectations as to placement duration, and the type of projects they undertake while at work. Student quality is also an unpredictable factor for employers {% cite clayton_australias_2019 %} {% cite jackson_employer_2017 %} {% cite sattler_work-integrated_2011 %}.

### Build a Guiding Coalition

Collaborative leadership serves as the foundation for driving this change initiative. The approach involves forming a guiding coalition, a WIL team, consisting of faculty members, students, industry partners, and college administrators. This coalition is composed of individuals with enough authority and influence to lead the change process. They spur stakeholders to work together, to implement needed strategies, and to oversee them during implementation {% cite kotter_leading_2007 bryson_strategic_2018 %}.

The team holds strategic planning sessions to explore and identify roles and responsibilities of each team member. A vision is formulated, including strategic goals of the team, that are aligned with the end state of embedded WIL in the Graphic Design program curriculum {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016  %}.

A collaborative approach is useful, where stakeholders share a language, mutual understanding and trust to achieve learning outcomes {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 lauer_change_2021 %}.

Employers play a central role in assessing student success while learning in the workplace. Consequently, employers and faculty need to employ a collaborative approach to ensure students have attained requisite learning outcomes through a rigorous, coordinated assessment process {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %}

### Fostering Readiness for Change

Then fostering their readiness to undertake the change initiative {% cite chappell_exploring_2016 conner_committing_1992 drew_issues_2010 gelaidan_employee_2018 janich_facilitator_2016 kotter_leading_2007 radwan_lead_2020 %}. With this shared understanding, each party recognizes the benefits enjoyed by participating. This builds intrinsic motivation for continued engagement. Absent these robust relationships, distrust can build, resulting in abandonment by some. Creating a strong coalition of stakeholders with clear understanding of the merits of WIL participation ensures ongoing stakeholder engagement. Of the stakeholders, faculty hold a special position as the initiators of WIL activities.

### Challenges

-   [Failure of organizational change](./bibliography/burnes_success_2011.html)
-   Why transformation fails [Kotter](./bibliography/kotter_leading_2007.html)

Without continued faculty engagement in WIL activities, its quality and frequency diminish. Stirling {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %} highlights that instructors must educate themselves about their roles as WIL facilitators and design curriculum that connects with workplace practice. This adds to already burdensome workloads, which, if not included in their standard workload formula, is generally met with resistance {% cite sony_barriers_2020 %}. This lack of recognition is remedied by allocating financial and human resources as a matter of course. This ensures the continuation of WIL activities for the long term, weathering changes in faculty and administrative staff.
