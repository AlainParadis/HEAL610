The research collectively reveals significant systemic barriers to inclusive participation in WIL programs across multiple demographic dimensions.

## Demographic Disparities in WIL Access and Experience

Multiple studies document concerning patterns of underrepresentation and inequitable experiences. Indigenous students comprise only 0.2% of WIL applicants despite making up 4.9% of Canada's population, while students with disabilities represent only 4.3% of applicants versus 13% of youth having at least one disability {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}. Women, despite graduating at higher rates than men, face significant barriers in WIL experiences, particularly in STEM and Business fields {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}.

The research identifies "sorting mechanisms" that systematically exclude diverse students, including GPA requirements, full-time placement mandates, and financial barriers through unpaid positions {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}{% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}. These mechanisms create structural exclusion that reproduces social inequality, even when unintentional.

## Differential Experiences During WIL Placements

Gender-based disparities are particularly pronounced. Women report significantly lower satisfaction with WIL experiences (76% versus 86% for men) and face multiple disadvantages: higher rates of unpaid positions (47% versus 28%), more discomfort at work (17% versus 8%), and alarmingly, 20% of women in in-person placements reported experiencing unwanted sexual behavior compared to only 1% of men {% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}.

Students with disabilities face barriers throughout the WIL process, from application (23% versus 13% for students without disabilities) to workplace integration, where they're more likely to feel ignored (27% versus 17%){% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}. Similarly, immigrant students encounter significantly more obstacles at every stage, being 23% more likely to experience barriers during placements{% cite chatoor_student_2023 %}.

## Effectiveness of Different WIL Models

Not all WIL formats yield equal benefits. Work-based WIL (internships, placements) demonstrates the strongest positive impact on employment outcomes, with participants 32% more likely to obtain full-time employment and 37% less likely to feel overqualified compared to non-participants {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}. In contrast, non-workplace WIL (classroom projects, simulations) shows significantly weaker outcomes, with participants 14% less likely to secure full-time employment {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}.

## Evidence-Based Strategies for Inclusive WIL

Research demonstrates that removing structural barriers significantly improves access. The CanWork program eliminated GPA requirements for students with disabilities, finding "no significant association between students' GPAs upon admission and their success in securing co-op placements"{% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}. Among successful participants, 45% would not have qualified under standard GPA requirements{% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}.

Effective support strategies include personalized coaching, specialized pre-employment training focused on self-advocacy and disclosure strategies, and flexible work structures{% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}. Additionally, engaging industry partners in equity discussions and developing formal EDI policies rather than case-by-case approaches is essential for creating inclusive workplace environments {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}.

The evidence suggests that truly inclusive WIL requires addressing barriers at multiple levels simultaneously: removing arbitrary requirements, providing specialized support throughout the WIL process, engaging industry partners in creating inclusive workplaces, and advocating for policy reforms to expand eligibility criteria for government funding programs {% cite itano-boase_exploring_2021 %}, {% cite tunny_future_2022 %}{% cite lamper_accessible_2024 %}.
