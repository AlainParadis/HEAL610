It analyses ways of thinking about quality, considers their relevance to higher education, explores their interrelationships and examines their philosophical and political underpinnings. The relative nature of quality is examined. First, quality means different things to different people. Second, quality is relative to 'processes' or 'outcomes'. The widely differing conceptualisations of quality are grouped into five discrete but interrelated categories. Quality can be viewed as exception, as perfection, as fitness for purpose, as value for money and as transformative."

Organisational change, however, cannot be ‘managed’ in this way, any more effectively than individual change can be ‘managed’ through psychotherapy. In both cases, a process can be initiated, but its outcomes cannot be guaranteed. Attempts to achieve certainty of outcome arise from the wish to avoid pain: but they are likely to result — paradoxically — in more permanent and serious damage to the people involved."

These efforts have gone under many banners: total quality management, reengineering, rightsizing, restructuring, cultural change, and turnarounds, to name a few. In almost every case, the goal has been to cope with a new, more challenging market by changing the way business is conducted. A few of these endeavors have been very successful. A few have been utter failures. Most fall somewhere in between, with a distinct tilt toward the lower end of the scale. John P. Kotter is renowned for his work on leading organizational change. In 1995, when this article was first published, he had just completed a ten-year study of more than 100 companies that attempted such a transformation. Here he shares the results of his observations, outlining the eight largest errors that can doom these efforts and explaining the general lessons that encourage success. Unsuccessful transitions almost always founder during at least one of the following phases: generating a sense of urgency, establishing a powerful guiding coalition, developing a vision, communicating the vision clearly and often, removing obstacles, planning for and creating short-term wins, avoiding premature declarations of victory, and embedding changes in the corporate culture. Realizing that change usually takes a long time, says Kotter, can improve the chances of success."
LJ78J6W3,journalArticle,2008,"Freudenberg, Brett; Brimble, Mark; Cameron, Craig",It’s all about ‘I’: Implementing ‘integration’ into a WIL program,,,,,,,"In recent years concerns have been raised about a gap emerging between graduate attributes and what industry requires (Yap, 1997; Albrecht and Sack, 2000). This is often referred to as a lack of ‘employment readiness’ of students and the need to engage industry with students and the curriculum. Such a concern was highlighted in the 2007 report titled ‘Graduate Employability Skills’ prepared for the Business, Industry and Higher Education Collaboration Council. While work integrated learning attempts to address this issue, it is questionable how successful this is if students are not adequately prepared prior to their placement. In an attempt to address this concern a Professional Development Program (the ‘PDP’) was developed. The PDP is integrated into the degree program and is designed to systematically develop students’ learning, employment and generic skills and supplements their theoretical studies. It is argued that this integration of the PDP permeating the Degree enhances students’ employment readiness. In addition, the PDP created other tangential benefits to the students and the university in terms of student engagement and motivation. This paper details the procedures that have been developed, and provides preliminary evidence on the impact of the first part of the PDP. It will be argued by the authors that to attain the possible benefits of a WIL program it is critical that practices and support mechanisms are adopted to emphases the ‘I – that is, the integration of work and learning."

Via semi-structured interviews with a cohort of senior leaders from one Australian university, this paper explores their perceptions of the key issues and challenges facing them in their work. The study found that the most significant challenges centred around the need for strategic leadership, flexibility, creativity and change-capability; responding to competing tensions and remaining relevant; maintaining academic quality; and managing fiscal and people resources. Sound interpersonal engagement, particularly in terms of change leadership capability, was found to be critical to meeting the key challenges identified by most participants. In light of the findings from the sample studied some tentative implications for leadership and leadership development in university environments are proposed, along with suggestions for further empirical exploration."

Speciﬁcally, I argue change fails because talk of change often suppresses, rather than celebrates, the emergence of conﬂicting organizational meanings. Embracing a constitutive perspective of communication and the notion that organizations are tension-ﬁlled, political sites of meaning-making talk, I argue that change fails when local articulations of alternative organizing discourses are unable to permeate mutually reinforcing understandings of organization. Meaningful change is thus enabled by creating open discursive spaces for organizational participants to constitute new organizing discourses. I provide the ﬁndings of a critically inspired, qualitative study of organizational change at a college of art and design to illustrate how embracing a constitutive-political perspective of communication can reveal how discourse alignment and conﬂict suppression during conversations contribute to failing change practices. This contribution provides a critically sensitive, discursive perspective of why change fails and extends an invitation for organizational scholars and practitioners to consider how conﬂictual conversations about a variety of possible organizational futures might better enable sustained organizational-change practices."

There is substantial evidence that some 70% of all change initiatives fail. This article explores the argument that a potentially signiﬁcant reason for this is a lack of alignment between the value system of the change intervention and of those members of an organization undergoing the change. In order to test this assertion, the article begins by reviewing the change literature with regard to the impact of values on success and failure. It then examines Graves’ Emergent Cyclical Levels of Existence Theory and uses this as the basis of a method for identifying and aligning value systems. The article then presents the results from case studies of two change initiatives in different organizations. These support both the method and the assertion that value system alignment may be an important factor in the success of organizational change initiatives. The article concludes with recommendations for further research."

This article critically reviews ﬁve separate published instances identifying a 70 per cent organizationalchange failure rate. In each instance, the review highlights the absence of valid and reliable empirical evidence in support of the espoused 70 per cent failure rate. Organizational-change research and scholarship now exists which enables us to question the belief in inherent organizational-change failure rates. Inherent failure rates are critically questioned in terms of the ambiguities of change, the context-dependent nature of change, competing perceptions, temporal aspects and measurability. In conclusion, whilst the existence of a popular narrative of 70 per cent organizational-change failure is acknowledged, there is no valid and reliable empirical evidence to support such a narrative."

This paper using a systematic and meta-analysis review of the literature published between 1980 and 2011 explored the major reasons for organisational change failure. Unsuccessful change programmes were attributed to insufficient education and training, employees’ apathy, inadequate management support, poor leadership, inappropriate organisational culture, inadequate resources, poor communication, inappropriate planning, insufficient customer focus, and lack of a monitoring and measurement system. Change-programme implementation and its impact depend on the ability of managers to adopt and adapt the change programme principles in their organisations. A well-designed, wisely adapted and well-implemented change programme helps managers achieve desired results. Identification of those factors that contribute to change success or failure enables change leaders to develop effective strategies for enhancing the chances of achieving desired outcomes."

The term 'work-integrated' is used both as a broader term than 'work-based', and to emphasise connectedness of learning as opposed to academic and workplace learning taking place in parallel but independently of each other. The review seeks to inform practice regarding degrees that include workplace learning and are sponsored by an employer, and particularly the development of degree apprenticeships. Its focus is on programmes that lead to an undergraduate or postgraduate higher education qualification and contain a substantial period of work-integrated learning that contributes to the accredited outcomes of the programme. It excludes programmes with short work placements, and it is not specifically designed to inform practice related to the provision of foundation degrees or level 4 or 5 apprenticeships, although much of the discussion will be relevant to them as well as, in part, to shorter collaborative programmes."

The article is intended for individuals working as facilitators as well as researchers interested in studying facilitation in planned change projects. Given the limited research that exists on this topic, the themes for facilitators withdrawing from a change project are based on ideas identified in general theories, empirical evidence involving organizational change processes, and sustainability literature related to project termination. The themes are related to a style of facilitation that supports, enables, and encourages individual team members and the team as a whole to work towards improving organizational processes and outcomes. The primary goals for this style of facilitation include increasing motivation and commitment, and individual and team learning. It is clear from this review that more research is needed regarding the facilitator’s withdrawal from planned change projects. However, the literature does offer practitioners some guidance for project withdrawal strategies."

It is a well-known and powerful means of communicating messages and engaging audiences. In this commentary paper, we present a framework for the integration of storytelling in systematic reviews and systematic maps at the stages where stakeholders are actively involved. Using storytelling to explain complex research has, in the past, not been considered a rigorous method of communicating science. But an increasing number of studies are showing how narratives can be useful for developing trust with an audience and increasing knowledge retention as well as the ability and willingness by audiences to learn and take action. Being easily digested by the human brain, stories help bridging between our logos and pathos; when an audience becomes emotionally receptive of facts, chances increase that they will respond and act on the knowledge. Here, we argue that storytelling holds potential as a tool in systematic reviews and systematic maps, serving mainly two purposes. First, collecting contextual narratives from stakeholders at the stages of question formulation and protocol writing can help to inform and generate relevant research questions and review designs. Here, we refer to contextual narratives as stories gathered from stakeholders to gain an understanding of their perspective. Second, creating a final story that faithfully presents the review results, while also relating to the contextual narratives, can contribute to effective communication of the results to stakeholders as well as to a broader audience. This approach can increase their engagement with the science and the implementation of evidence-based decisions. The paper concludes that storytelling holds untapped potential for communicating evidence from systematic reviews and maps for increased stakeholder engagement. It is time for researchers and research networks such as the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence to support and emphasize the importance of exploring new tools for effective science communication, such as storytelling."

This chapter captures the worldwide quality issues and a controversy related to implementation of quality management in higher education, identifies the barriers for successful implementation of quality management in higher education, reviews the key barriers that deter the efforts to effectively execute quality management in higher education so that quality management strategies can be formulated by the top management and policymakers accordingly, and presents directions for future research."

Students potentially learn professional behaviours appropriate to their chosen industry sector. However, students may also face challenges they may not be prepared to navigate. One of these is gender bias due to assumptions about women and work, particularly within STEM sectors. This article presents ﬁndings from a pilot study that explores WIL students’ perspectives on gender bias related to experiences at their internship placements or other jobs. The ﬁndings suggest that the potential lack of gender neutrality within organizations such as WIL placements, is nuanced through an underlying bias around thinking about gender, women and work, and demonstrated through institutional structures such as branded recruitment campaigns or the individual micro aggressions of co-workers and supervisors. Further research needs to focus on the impact of gender bias on students’ sense of value within diﬀerent organizations, and the strategies they employ to navigate bias. In the short-term, all students need tools to help them understand how gender is constructed within organizational processes and how to develop strategies to help them confront gender bias within the organizations in which they work."

However, the literature indicates that many international students struggle in WIL despite continuous eﬀorts by higher education institutions. A scoping review will inform future research and practice that seeks to enhance the WIL experiences of international students. This scoping review, guided by a transition framework, synthesized and analyzed ﬁndings from 22 empirical studies published during 2009–2020 related to challenges to international undergraduate students in WIL. Results show that while a range of challenges to this student cohort in WIL has been well established in the literature, little is known about how international students exercise their agency in navigating challenges to enhance WIL experiences. The scoping review has two major theoretical contributions: (i) establishing a novel typology of challenges to international students in WIL and (ii) proposing a context-speciﬁc research approach which facilitates inquiry into salient aspects of international students’ WIL engagement in given contexts. The review concludes with recommendations for future research and practice from a transition perspective."

Key strategies to enhance graduate employability and employment outcomes are work-integrated learning (WIL) (where students engage with industry as part of their formal learning and assessment) and cocurricular activities (e.g. volunteering, leadership/award, and mentoring programmes), which are facilitated by the university but not embedded into curricula. While WIL is widely recognised for enhancing diﬀerent aspects of student employability, the impact of co-curricular activities is less well-known. Further, there is a lack of empirical analysis on the nuanced impact of diﬀerent forms of WIL and co-curricular activities on graduate outcomes. This research sought to explore the impact of a range of WIL and co-curricular activities on labour force outcomes among new higher education graduates. Findings are informed by national survey data for 51,883 domestic graduates of both coursework and research degrees in Australia. They point to a strong labour market advantage from work-based WIL for Bachelor graduates, while undergraduate participation in co-curricular activities appeared to have less eﬀect on labour force outcomes. However, there were consistent, positive results for industry mentoring and leadership/award programmes for increasing the chances of securing full-time work and reducing the likelihood of perceived overqualiﬁcation among Bachelor and postgraduate coursework graduates. Implications for stakeholders and practice are discussed, as well as directions for future research."

The objective of incorporating WIL into education is to foster the integration of theoretical understanding by engaging students in a combination of academic coursework and hands-on work-related activities. With the rise in unemployment, WIL appears to help organizations to get graduates that have all the attributes and skills relevant in the world or work, thereby expanding and growing their businesses ensuring greater prosperity for all concerned. The aim of this article was to assess the role Work Integrated Learning in accelerating Graduate Employability. Four WIL coordinators from different academic programmes that offer WIL as a module participated in this paper. Data was analysed using Thematic analysis, following Braun & Clark steps. The study revealed a direct correlation between academic performance and practical application in the professional setting. This paper therefore argues that WIL programmes can contribute immensely to the overall development of graduates and increase their chances of employment. The study revealed that WIL coordinators should review placement arrangements to improve WIL. This study found that Work Integrated Learning (WIL) has a positive effect on graduate employability and skills development, and that university WIL coordinators should review placement arrangements to ensure that students have enough training and development prior to placement."

Despite the benefits, such programs are recognised as being more time consuming to design and deliver, and therefore have implications for the workload of academic staff. Prompted by a lack of empirical data substantiating such claims, and the roll out of an institution-wide approach to WIL at an Australian university, this study was initiated to collect data on the amount of work and types of tasks involved in teaching, administering and supporting WIL courses. Specifically, the following research questions were investigated: 1) How much time is spent on the delivery of WIL courses? 2) What tasks are involved in the delivery of WIL? 3) What are the key drivers of WIL workload? Twenty-eight WIL unit (course) convenors provided workload data on 48 WIL units via surveys, with 30 staff also participating in interviews. Findings confirm that WIL workload is substantial, with key drivers relating to the unit characteristics and nature of the WIL activity. Implications for practice, policy and future research are discussed."
