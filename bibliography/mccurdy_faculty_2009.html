<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Faculty views on their involvement with work‐integrated (WIL) learning programs is an under‐researched area, yet faculty involvement and commitment is vital to the successful running of such programs. This research investigates faculty views of a WIL program at the University of Waikato and covers four main areas; their perceptions of the value of their involvement with WIL, faculty views on the value of work placements for students and influence on student performance, faculty views on the influence of placements on student skill development and future directions and faculty perceptions of assessment of placements. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, science and engineering faculty (N = 142) were surveyed using both open and closed questions. Faculty were generally supportive of the WIL program, which is seen as enhancing the university’s reputation, and as a good tool for student recruitment. They felt that negative impacts included a lack of recognition in workload models and promotion, and that their involvement with WIL did not improve joint research or joint funding opportunities. Faculty perceived that students learned new skills on placement, which were not learned at university, and that WIL students were more employable than their non‐WIL counterparts. In contrast, WIL students were not viewed as being better prepared for graduate studies or writeup of thesis ‐ despite thinking that writing placement reports enhanced students’ writing skills. WIL students were seen as equally suitable for graduate studies, but WIL is not viewed as engaging students in deep learning. (Journal of Cooperative Education & Internships, 43(1), 36‐53).</p>
