<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Across advanced industrial economies, programs in higher education are increasingly becoming occupationally specific and universities as are being seen as providers of „higher vocational education‟. With this have come expectations that graduates from these programs will enjoy smooth transitions into professional practice. Aligned with these expectations is an educational emphasis on providing students with access to and engagement in authentic instances of practice and an expectation that these will be effectively integrated within higher education programs. Consequently, it is important to understand how these kinds of educational purposes and processes can be realised and how higher education students‟ experiences in both university and practice settings should be best organised and integrated to realise these purposes. This paper discusses the worth of these educational purposes and bases for realising the effective integration of these work experience. This discussion includes considerations of the kinds of curriculum and pedagogic practices needed to be enacted to secure this educational worth.</p>
