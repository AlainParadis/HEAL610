<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigated the quality of work-integrated learning (WIL) assessment design, in higher education programs, through review of peer-reviewed studies published internationally and in English, 1990–2015. Such a review is timely in light of vested interest from a range of WIL stakeholders; high-level endorsement of WIL across university programs; a regulatory environment requiring development and assurance of higher-order learning outcomes; and a WIL assessment literature that identifies a number of challenges and opportunities. We searched six electronic databases, yielding 20 intervention studies that met inclusion criteria. Findings reveal high-quality assessment design, albeit a need for greater involvement of industry/professional partners in assessment practices, and stronger alignment between reflective activities and students’ WIL experiences. The evidence base under review largely comprised qualitative and mixed methods studies, with indication that the quality of study design had improved over time, although variably across disciplinary fields. The key recommendation from this review is that resources are needed to support research-active WIL academics and partners and students: a). to design and participate in assessment practices, which promote integration of student learning, across university and work settings, and achievement of higher-order learning outcomes; and b). to pursue a collaborative research agenda involving robust evaluation research, inclusive of quantitative studies.</p>
