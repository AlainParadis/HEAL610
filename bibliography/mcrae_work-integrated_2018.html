<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In many parts of the world, including Canada, there are calls for an increase in the number of workintegrated learning opportunities for post-secondary students. As attention is paid to increasing the quantity of WIL programs, it is critically important to ensure that attention is also paid to the quality of WIL experiences for key stakeholders. This paper provides an overview of the quality landscape in higher education and work-integrated learning and presents a work-integrated learning quality framework: AAA★. The AAA★ framework, and the remainder of the paper, is comprised of five sections: (1) concepts and terminology used in the framework; (2) the aims of each of the WIL stakeholder groups; (3) the actions required by each stakeholder to ensure success; (4) the achievements of each of the stakeholder groups; and (5) a continuous improvement process for WIL programs. This work will enable those responsible for WIL programs to identify potential gaps in providing quality WIL as well as providing a list of potential outcomes and measures that can be used to evaluate WIL programs.</p>
