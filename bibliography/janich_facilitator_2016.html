<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The focus of this article is on strategies and guidelines for external facilitators withdrawing from planned change projects in organizations. The article is intended for individuals working as facilitators as well as researchers interested in studying facilitation in planned change projects. Given the limited research that exists on this topic, the themes for facilitators withdrawing from a change project are based on ideas identified in general theories, empirical evidence involving organizational change processes, and sustainability literature related to project termination. The themes are related to a style of facilitation that supports, enables, and encourages individual team members and the team as a whole to work towards improving organizational processes and outcomes. The primary goals for this style of facilitation include increasing motivation and commitment, and individual and team learning. It is clear from this review that more research is needed regarding the facilitatorâ€™s withdrawal from planned change projects. However, the literature does offer practitioners some guidance for project withdrawal strategies.</p>
