<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examined diﬀerences in the psychological constructs of motivation, academic self-eﬃcacy, and learning strategies between higher education students who participated in a work-integrated learning (WIL) programme and those who did not. Undergraduate WIL (n = 1048) and non-WIL (n = 656) students in all years of study and from several academic faculties, completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), which measures the constructs of motivation, academic self-eﬃcacy and use of learning and study strategies. Results revealed that students who do not gain practical work experience while pursuing their studies have lower grade-point averages, are more likely to use shallow learning strategies, and are more extrinsically motivated compared to students who do gain work experience through a WIL programme. Diﬀerences in academic self-eﬃcacy as a function of WIL were not found, however, signiﬁcant relationships between self-eﬃcacy, motivation, learning strategies, academic performance and anxiety did emerge. Implications and recommendation for future research are provided.</p>
