<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Applying your creativity to shape a career communicating ideas and concepts. 
The three-year Graphic Design Ontario College Advanced Diploma program helps you apply your creativity to communicating ideas and concepts in both print and interactive media. 
Using a combination of theoretical and hands-on learning, you gain skills in design, typography, image, colour, coding, motion graphics, interaction and production from industry-connected faculty. You learn to be a problem-solver who can manage and execute visual design projects. 
Whether learning design for the page or for the screen, you study industry-endorsed concepts and techniques. You also become an expert at communicating ideas to a client through: 

sketches 
prototypes 
storyboards 
interactive mock-ups 
There is a strong focus on hands-on training, using industry-standard software tools, which will ensure you are career-ready upon graduation. Field trips and actual client projects are offered to bring the workplace into the classroom. 
From your second year on, you become a student-member of the Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario. In your final semester, you embark on a six-week fieldwork placement that transitions you to industry. You work side-by-side with experienced professionals and gain networking contacts. 
Upon graduation, you will have developed a design portfolio that showcases your creativity and problem-solving skills. You will display your work at the annual Grad Show exhibition.
