<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The University of Victoria, Canada, strives to enhance undergraduate studentsâ€™ labor market readiness through work-integrated learning (WIL) experiences. Students with disabilities have historically encountered low participation and success rates in WIL, potentially resulting in their under-representation in the post-graduation labor market. To address this issue, the CanWork program was created, aimed at eliminating participation barriers in co-operative education for students with disabilities. The program offered tailored support, including job development, one-on-one guidance at all stages, and the removal of grade point average (GPA) thresholds. As of its completion in September 2022, the CanWork program facilitated pre-employment training for 107 students with disabilities and 84 co-op work placements. Demographic-specific and personalized support mechanisms boosted participation and success rates for students with disabilities in work-integrated learning. Furthermore, an analysis of program data highlights that GPA requirements in well-resourced programs create unnecessary barriers for students with disabilities. (DEI)</p>
