<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> There is an increasing focus on the student as the nexus of integrating classroom and workplace learning. In the university context students are learners and in the workplace context students are pre-accredited professionals and in both contexts they can be facilitators of peer learning. Student participation in professional roles through workplace learning experiences are opportunities for transformative learning that shape professional identity formation and a sense of professionalism. Drawing on a higher education literature review of professional identity formation and a case study that explored how professionalism was understood, talked about and experienced by lecturers and students, this paper explores the role of work-integrated learning and its place in the curriculum to enhance professional identity development and professionalism.</p>
