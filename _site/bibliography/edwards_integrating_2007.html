<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Work Integrated Learning is a feature of many engineering degree programs. The accreditation of Australian undergraduate engineering degrees requires the inclusion of certain Work Integrated Learning activities. Effective use of Work Integrated Learning requires embedding the Work Integrated Learning activities in the program design, not just adding a Work Integrated Learning activity to the program. The WIL Industry Affiliates Program which has operated in microelectronic for 18 years has recently been introduced into all engineering undergraduate programs at Griffith University. The Industry Affiliates Program is now being extended to all Science, Environment, Engineering and Technology undergraduate programs. The Industry Affiliates Program for engineering is a “semester-in-industry”, in the first semester of the final year, during which students work on a joint industry-university supervised project. The positive impact of the inclusion of this “semester-in-industry” Industry Affiliates Program on the program structure and content, from first year to final year, will be discussed.</p>
