<div class="abstract">

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) programs are becoming popular with students, government, employers, and universities. A major benefit of a WIL program is the increased employability of students, and this matches well with the present trend whereby students expect a pay- off from their investment in education. Although WIL programs are more common in some profession-based undergraduate courses than others, they have not been frequently discussed in relation to accounting in the Australian context. This paper discusses issues related to designing a WIL program for an undergraduate accounting program in an Australian context. The importance of WIL programs in general is followed by discussion on how WIL, work and knowledge are related to each other. The types of available WIL programs are discussed in relation to their applicability to an accounting program. Issues relating to designing a successful WIL program are discussed by its accounting faculty, academics, employers, professional accounting bodies and the government as stakeholders in the program. The WIL program’s implications for the accounting curriculum are also discussed.

    This paper presents a framework for the use of storytelling to accelerate the engagement of various stakeholders with organizational transformation. Though storytelling is associated with organizational change, and research into organizational storytelling is extensive, it has yet to be adapted into a method for the practicing storyteller. To fill this knowledge gap, a review of the literature is conducted, which informs a framework for organizational storytelling adopting the practitioner’s lens. This has been used in workshops with senior executives from large, small and medium-sized enterprises, who have expressed the need for stories to engage stakeholders with advanced services.

<div class="abstract">

    Over the past few decades, a new form of governance has emerged to replace adversarial and managerial modes of policy making and implementation. Collaborative governance, as it has come to be known, brings public and private stakeholders together in collective forums with public agencies to engage in consensus-oriented decision making. In this article, we conduct a meta-analytical study of the existing literature on collaborative governance with the goal of elaborating a contingency model of collaborative governance. After reviewing 137 cases of collaborative governance across a range of policy sectors, we identify critical variables that will inﬂuence whether or not this mode of governance will produce successful collaboration. These variables include the prior history of conﬂict or cooperation, the incentives for stakeholders to participate, power and resources imbalances, leadership, and institutional design. We also identify a series of factors that are crucial within the collaborative process itself. These factors include face-to-face dialogue, trust building, and the development of commitment and shared understanding. We found that a virtuous cycle of collaboration tends to develop when collaborative forums focus on ‘‘small wins’’ that deepen trust, commitment, and shared understanding. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our contingency model for practitioners and for future research on collaborative governance.

    The delivery of work-integrated learning (WIL) courses involves university academic and professional staff in specific duties, many of which are outside of the scope of the traditional categories used by universities to determine equitable workloads for academic and administrative personnel. This paper draws on an investigation in a metropolitan university in Australia and records how it is beginning to arrive at appropriate ways to do this. A survey tool was utilised to identify the specific workload demands on staff who worked with WIL courses. The data provided information that confirmed the complexity of the work and also showed that there was a gap between the reality of the workload and the allocation provided. A number of recommendations have been made as a way forward. Further research is recommended that could include the perspectives of students and organisational supervisors reporting on the level of academic staff member support and supervision

    Abstract There is a growing belief that higher education institutions should nurture a ‘quality culture’ in which structural/managerial and cultural/psychological elements act in synergy to continuously improve education. Notwithstanding the positive connotation of the ‘quality culture’ concept, its exact configuration remains subject to debate. A realist review was conducted to identify inhibiting and promoting organisational context elements impacting quality culture, its working mechanisms and associated outcomes. Leadership and communication were identified as being of key importance in binding struc- tural/managerial and cultural/psychological elements. Leaders are central ‘drivers’ of quality culture development through their ability to influence resource allocation, clarify roles and responsibilities, create partnerships and optimise people and process manage- ment. Adequate communication is considered a prerequisite to diffuse quality strategies and policies, evaluate results and identify staff values and beliefs. It is proposed that the working mechanisms of quality culture comprise increased staff commitment, shared ownership, empowerment and knowledge. Associated outcomes related to these mecha- nisms are positive effects on staff and student satisfaction, continuous improvement of the teaching–learning process and student and teacher learning and development.

<div class="abstract">

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) is recognised as a valuable pedagogical strategy for learning, and for providing students with work experience during their degree program. Despite the benefits, such programs are recognised as being more time consuming to design and deliver, and therefore have implications for the workload of academic staff. Prompted by a lack of empirical data substantiating such claims, and the roll out of an institution-wide approach to WIL at an Australian university, this study was initiated to collect data on the amount of work and types of tasks involved in teaching, administering and supporting WIL courses. Specifically, the following research questions were investigated: 1) How much time is spent on the delivery of WIL courses? 2) What tasks are involved in the delivery of WIL? 3) What are the key drivers of WIL workload? Twenty-eight WIL unit (course) convenors provided workload data on 48 WIL units via surveys, with 30 staff also participating in interviews. Findings confirm that WIL workload is substantial, with key drivers relating to the unit characteristics and nature of the WIL activity. Implications for practice, policy and future research are discussed.

    Across advanced industrial economies, programs in higher education are increasingly becoming occupationally specific and universities as are being seen as providers of „higher vocational education‟. With this have come expectations that graduates from these programs will enjoy smooth transitions into professional practice. Aligned with these expectations is an educational emphasis on providing students with access to and engagement in authentic instances of practice and an expectation that these will be effectively integrated within higher education programs. Consequently, it is important to understand how these kinds of educational purposes and processes can be realised and how higher education students‟ experiences in both university and practice settings should be best organised and integrated to realise these purposes. This paper discusses the worth of these educational purposes and bases for realising the effective integration of these work experience. This discussion includes considerations of the kinds of curriculum and pedagogic practices needed to be enacted to secure this educational worth.

    The process of defining, measuring, and assuring quality in higher education has been influenced by the quality movement that began originally in business and industry. The notion of building quality cultures, whereby all parties with a vested interest in the success of the enterprise take responsibility for insuring qualities at all levels, requires fostering a set of shared beliefs and values, along with developing a structure for coordinating quality reviews at multiple levels that will occur cyclically.

    Contemporary perspectives of higher education endorse a work integrated learning (WIL) approach to curriculum content, delivery and assessment. It is agreed that authenticity in learning relates to real-world experience, however, differentiating and strategically linking WIL provision and facilitation to assessment tasks and collation of authentic student evidence is critical. Irrespective of whether authentic learning tasks can be achieved in the education or workplace settings, the imperative of why an assessment is regarded as highly or minimally authentic needs to be better understood. The literature doesn’t clearly describe such parameters for assessments, nor does comprehensive course review (CCR) use a structured framework to analyze WIL assessments in curriculum. An Authentic Assessment Framework (AAF) was designed to assist this gap in CCR and piloted at Curtin University to enable a consistent approach across programs and disciplines. This paper describes the process for developing that framework, highlighting the effectiveness in engaging WIL practitioners and informing authentic curriculum development.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) aﬀords students opportunities to apply skills and knowledge to practical work placements. Students potentially learn professional behaviours appropriate to their chosen industry sector. However, students may also face challenges they may not be prepared to navigate. One of these is gender bias due to assumptions about women and work, particularly within STEM sectors. This article presents ﬁndings from a pilot study that explores WIL students’ perspectives on gender bias related to experiences at their internship placements or other jobs. The ﬁndings suggest that the potential lack of gender neutrality within organizations such as WIL placements, is nuanced through an underlying bias around thinking about gender, women and work, and demonstrated through institutional structures such as branded recruitment campaigns or the individual micro aggressions of co-workers and supervisors. Further research needs to focus on the impact of gender bias on students’ sense of value within diﬀerent organizations, and the strategies they employ to navigate bias. In the short-term, all students need tools to help them understand how gender is constructed within organizational processes and how to develop strategies to help them confront gender bias within the organizations in which they work.

    Work-Integrated Learning in the 21st century: Global perspectives on the future, explores new questions about the state of work for new university and college graduates in the context of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL). As these ’Millennials’ graduate, they are entering a precarious labour market that is filled with ambiguity and uncertainty, creating a great deal of anxiety for those trying to develop skills for highly competitive jobs or jobs that do not yet exist. In their pursuit of skill acquisition, many are participating in WIL programs (e.g., cooperative education, internships) which allow them to gain practical experience while pursuing their education. With a focus on WIL, this book examines issues involved in developing work ready graduates. Topics include mental health and well-being - an urgent matter on many campuses; remote working - an aspect of the information and social media age that is becoming more prevalent as the precarity of work increases; issues of diversity and discrimination; ethics and professionalism; global citizenship and competency; and the role that higher education institutions need to play to prepare students for the challenges of economic shifts. These topics are timely and relevant to the situations faced by new graduates and those who prepare them for the world beyond school. The chapters provide a close examination of the issues from a global perspective, particularly as experiential education and work-integrated learning programs are becoming more prevalent in higher education and viewed as essential for preparing millennials for the 21st century competitive labour market. –

    Social media, network capabilities, and digital communication technologies are changing the nature of work for individuals in WIL programs; further challenging the connections between industries and universities in their efforts to ensure individuals are work ready. However, digital technologies have provided new resources to help individuals socialize into the workplace and develop new skills for meeting the challenges of the information age that will also impact on how they get a job, and then do that job. The current literature on WIL, organizational behavior, and remote working, provides a theoretical framework for identifying the key points on the transitions experienced by individuals through WIL using the prism of social media, digital technologies, and the changes in work culture through remote working. Key issues in relation to transition are illustrated using two examples: one

    In recent years concern amongst higher education’s stakeholders has been growing in relation to teaching and learning performance and outcomes. One technique that can assist in improving students’ development of professional skills and understanding is work integrated learning (WIL). For the universities this is a difficult challenge with limited resources, large and diverse student cohorts and the ever present ‘publish or perish’ paradigm that draws lecturers’ attention away from teaching and learning activities. This article addresses whether universities have the adequate resources and vision to see ‘work integrated learning’ (WIL) adopted in sustained and systematic manner to improve students’ skills.

    One of the most remarkable aspects of organizational change efforts is their low success rate. There is substantial evidence that some 70% of all change initiatives fail. This article explores the argument that a potentially signiﬁcant reason for this is a lack of alignment between the value system of the change intervention and of those members of an organization undergoing the change. In order to test this assertion, the article begins by reviewing the change literature with regard to the impact of values on success and failure. It then examines Graves’ Emergent Cyclical Levels of Existence Theory and uses this as the basis of a method for identifying and aligning value systems. The article then presents the results from case studies of two change initiatives in different organizations. These support both the method and the assertion that value system alignment may be an important factor in the success of organizational change initiatives. The article concludes with recommendations for further research.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) is a risky business for universities. WIL is a strategic risk worthy of pursuing by universities in the prevailing higher education environment, which is characterized by competition, changes in funding arrangements and stakeholder demand for WIL. Nevertheless the strategic opportunities that WIL presents cannot be achieved without the university taking on unavoidable and distinct legal risks that may have serious financial and reputational consequences for the university. This article examines WIL through a lens of enterprise risk management. The author describes how WIL is a strategic risk for universities, and identifies the possible legal risks of WIL through a review of empirical studies and case law in Australia. It is argued that risk management involves a balance between the university goals of maximizing the strategic value and minimizing the legal risks in relation to WIL.

    Work-integrated learning is a common approach to add practical, real-world work experience to academic settings. Traditional coop programs in colleges and universities alternate courses with semesters spent as an intern at a relevant workplace. We have designed an academic-industry partnership that takes work-integrated learning further by deliberately aligning workplace experience to the academic curriculum. Our students earn a Bachelor of Computer Science from the university, and are paid employees of the industry partner throughout their degree. While advanced courses and electives are taken on campus as usual, some core computer science classes and practicum courses are delivered with the industry partner so as to integrate them with placements on site. Assessment remains the responsibility of the university. In this report, we describe the partnership from the perspective of the industry partner. We describe our goals, partnership design, and first two iterations of the implementation. We discuss the challenges we have faced with our first cohort, and share suggestions for others looking to create similar programs.

    Purpose – Employability is a key concept in higher education. Graduate employment rate is often used to assess the quality of university provision, despite that employability and employment are two different concepts. This paper will increase the understandings of graduate employability through interpreting its meaning and whose responsibility for graduate employability from the perspectives of four key stakeholders: higher education institutions, students, government and employers.

<div class="abstract">

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) courses can be more time consuming and resource intensive to design, teach, administer and support than classroom-based courses, as they generally require different curricula and pedagogical approaches as well as additional administrative and pastoral responsibilities. Workload and resourcing issues are reported as key challenges to the implementation of WIL, but most of the evidence to date is anecdotal. Accurately quantifying workload associated with WIL is dif cult, because teaching and administrative roles can be so interconnected. To address this gap in the literature and inform institutional practice, a study was initiated at an Australian university to collect empirical data on the type and amount of work involved in delivering WIL courses. This paper describes the process of survey development, including literature review, extensive consultation phase and pilot study, all of which had to take account of the inherent power dynamics, politics and sensitivities around measuring staff workload.

<div class="abstract">

    This chapter describes how the development of work-integrated learning (WIL) has become an increasingly important component of both curriculum and pedagogy across a wide range of disciplines in Australia’s universities. This has been driven by institutions reacting to government and industry demands for work-relevant degrees and work-ready graduates. The chapter analyzes five of the eight action areas in the National WIL Strategy. A number of barriers to further implementation are identified and discussed, including funding, institutional constraints, assessment challenges, and employer capacity, particularly in smaller companies. Ways forward include developing quality information and the resources to support implementation, growing champions of the process in institutions and employers, and developing alternative approaches to delivery given the pressure placed on industry for work placements by all sectors of Australian education.

    This paper presents findings from Stage 4 of the Griffith Graduate Project. Graduates from three Schools within Griffith University were surveyed to determine their perceptions of the contributions that the learning contexts of university, work placement and post-graduation employment made to the development of their generic skills. All graduates involved in the project had experienced work placement as a formal part of their undergraduate studies. Supplementary data from focus group discussions held with employers and graduates are also included. Findings showed that while graduates recognized the contribution university had made to their generic skills development, they greatly valued the experience of learning in the workplace during placement and subsequently in employment. The importance of teamwork, being given responsibility, and collaborative learning emerged as the most important factors for effective learning in the three contexts under consideration.

<div class="abstract">

    Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) is an important pedagogical strategy for developing employability skills by immersing students in real-world understandings, applications and practices. Increasingly, universities are focusing on how WIL can be scaffolded across a degree, to involve students in a variety of WIL activities in order to apply disciplinary knowledge and skills. While placement models appear to be the dominant mode of WIL that are easily recognised within a degree structure, non-placement forms of WIL while emerging, remain less visible. This conceptual paper presents an institutional framework that accounts for a range of placement and non-placement WIL activities, to make WIL practices overt across a degree. It introduces the Work-Integrated Learning Curriculum Classification (WILCC) Framework that supports a university-wide approach for developing, mapping and reporting WIL. The WILCC Framework promotes the visibility of WIL across the institution, offers a common language for WIL across disciplines, and provides a tool to scaffold WIL experiences throughout degree programs.

    This paper explores academics’ perceptions of work-integrated learning (WIL) resourcing provisions and challenges at one institution to better envisage institutional support for WIL. The study draws on the WIL Curriculum Classification Framework to unpack how support and resourcing aligns to different modes of WIL. This study reports on the perceptions of 95 academics from a range of disciplines, teaching a variety of WIL activities. Findings are organized under core resourcing challenges: workload and recognition; developing WIL; administering and scaling WIL; sustainable management of industry relationships, and; other support requirements. Findings suggest mixed perceptions on WIL resourcing, space for more WIL integration in subjects, and consensus on the under-recognition of WIL work. Findings highlight the invisibility of academics’ efforts to embed WIL in curriculum, showing clashes in workload modelling and WIL practices. The study has implications for institutional WIL resourcing and recommends more coherent policies for recognition of WIL work.

    Embedded Work Integrated Learning (EWIL) is a specific model of Work Integrated Learning (WIL); students work with industry in small blocks of time at regular intervals throughout semester focussing on reflective learning in authentic work environments. This study highlights benefits and challenges experienced when incorporating EWIL into a university education degree. Data was collected through survey and interview; students and graduates were surveyed and industry partners were interviewed. Reflections from university staff involved in the degree were also included. Results demonstrate EWIL is an effective pedagogical strategy in terms of providing authentic, real world learning experiences and enhancing students’ employability skills. Specifically, students’ communication skills, organisational abilities and confidence are enriched. Challenges encountered included time constraints, increasing student cohort size and staffing changes. These challenges can be overcome with planning and relationship development. The findings of this study provide insight and guidance for institutions considering implementing EWIL models into comparable university programs.

    Purpose – Work-integrated learning (WIL) has emerged as a leading pedagogy that blends theory with application. In recent years, policymakers, educators and practitioners have called for a significant expansion of WIL, one which would enable every undergraduate student has at least one WIL experience during their program of study. Despite these appeals, there remains a significant divide between the aspiration of universality and the realities. Consequently, the study asks the following question: How can post-secondary institutions expand their WIL initiatives to universal levels that deliver transformative learning? Design/methodology/approach – In this exploratory study, the authors leverage research from entrepreneurship and management to develop a conceptual model of universal work-integrated learning (UWIL). Entrepreneurship and management research is relevant in this context, as the rapid introduction of a UWIL has transformative implications at the level of the individual (e.g. students, faculty), organization (e.g. processes) and the learning ecosystem (e.g. partners, policymakers) — issues at the core of research in entrepreneurship and management over the past two decades.

    It is proposed from this study that engaging productively with others to achieve change has never been more critical in educational environments, such as universities. Via semi-structured interviews with a cohort of senior leaders from one Australian university, this paper explores their perceptions of the key issues and challenges facing them in their work. The study found that the most significant challenges centred around the need for strategic leadership, flexibility, creativity and change-capability; responding to competing tensions and remaining relevant; maintaining academic quality; and managing fiscal and people resources. Sound interpersonal engagement, particularly in terms of change leadership capability, was found to be critical to meeting the key challenges identified by most participants. In light of the findings from the sample studied some tentative implications for leadership and leadership development in university environments are proposed, along with suggestions for further empirical exploration.

    This study examined diﬀerences in the psychological constructs of motivation, academic self-eﬃcacy, and learning strategies between higher education students who participated in a work-integrated learning (WIL) programme and those who did not. Undergraduate WIL (n = 1048) and non-WIL (n = 656) students in all years of study and from several academic faculties, completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), which measures the constructs of motivation, academic self-eﬃcacy and use of learning and study strategies. Results revealed that students who do not gain practical work experience while pursuing their studies have lower grade-point averages, are more likely to use shallow learning strategies, and are more extrinsically motivated compared to students who do gain work experience through a WIL programme. Diﬀerences in academic self-eﬃcacy as a function of WIL were not found, however, signiﬁcant relationships between self-eﬃcacy, motivation, learning strategies, academic performance and anxiety did emerge. Implications and recommendation for future research are provided.

    To survive in a highly-competitive higher education sector, institutions of higher learning are focusing on quality management principles. Therefore, a strong need emerges for a deeper understanding of quality management. Despite a substantial, growing interest from scholars, policymakers, and educationalists in quality management as a common phenomenon in higher education, many obstacles remain in the implementation process. This chapter captures the worldwide quality issues and a controversy related to implementation of quality management in higher education, identifies the barriers for successful implementation of quality management in higher education, reviews the key barriers that deter the efforts to effectively execute quality management in higher education so that quality management strategies can be formulated by the top management and policymakers accordingly, and presents directions for future research.

    Work Integrated Learning is a feature of many engineering degree programs. The accreditation of Australian undergraduate engineering degrees requires the inclusion of certain Work Integrated Learning activities. Effective use of Work Integrated Learning requires embedding the Work Integrated Learning activities in the program design, not just adding a Work Integrated Learning activity to the program. The WIL Industry Affiliates Program which has operated in microelectronic for 18 years has recently been introduced into all engineering undergraduate programs at Griffith University. The Industry Affiliates Program is now being extended to all Science, Environment, Engineering and Technology undergraduate programs. The Industry Affiliates Program for engineering is a “semester-in-industry”, in the first semester of the final year, during which students work on a joint industry-university supervised project. The positive impact of the inclusion of this “semester-in-industry” Industry Affiliates Program on the program structure and content, from first year to final year, will be discussed.

    Work Integrated Learning (WIL) increases the ‘work readiness’ of university graduates but it is a complex undertaking and involves numerous risks for the stakeholders involved. A systematic review of the literature published between 2012 and 2017 reveals that the discourses related to risk and WIL are quite limited with the perspectives of key stakeholders receiving little attention. To address these shortcomings, a stakeholder centric model is proposed that conceptualises risk as a network of potentially fragile relationships and interactions, centred on the student, and involving all key WIL stakeholders. This Stakeholder Interaction (SI) model provides a framework for the analysis of risk from the perspectives of each stakeholder in turn and as such, has the potential to inform the management of risk in WIL more broadly and address some gaps in academic discourse and practice.

    Authentic learning experiences that replicate workplace settings are essential elements of the student experience for optimising graduate employability outcomes. Work Integrated Learning (WIL) supports the development of generic attributes which are highly regarded by employers through embedding authentic learning experiences in curricular and co-curricular programs. The regulatory and standards-based environment which monitors and controls higher education institutions’ operations is increasingly focussing on WIL and the employability capabilities of graduates. In addition, external stakeholders such as employers and community agencies expect that graduates are prepared for a global and uncertain job market. The ultimate aim is to build a competitive and sustainable Australian economy through ensuring a highly-skilled population. Higher education is considered a key mechanism for achieving this ambition. Reconceptualising curriculum development and assessment strategies is required in order to address these societal demands.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) enables the embedding of relevant real-world learning into curriculum resulting in students that are better prepared to enter the workforce and meet demands of employers seeking work-ready graduates. Research confirms students who undertake WIL as part of their degree consistently achieve better employment outcomes. Industry’s role in WIL is critical and, therefore, engagement with industry partners is essential to determine what is required to support their engagement and contribution to WIL. This Office of Learning and Teaching funded research project, aimed to determine the topics, format and mode of resources industry perceives as most useful. The project used a mixed methods approach to gather data from a range of sources with findings confirming industry are seeking resources on assessment, feedback and supervision of students as well as information on clarification of roles and negotiating partnerships. The project outcomes informed the development of user-friendly and accessible resources for industry. (Asia-Pacific Journal of Cooperative Education, 2016, 17(4), 363-375)

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) experiences rely heavily on the development of relationships between the university, industry and often community organizations. As participation in WIL is increasing, the issue of sustainability becomes paramount, requiring processes and practices for effective collaborations and partnerships. This paper reports on an action research project to develop a framework to represent the critical success factors for sustainable WIL relationships. Drawing on reflections from WIL practitioners on what they considered were the critical success factors and a review of literature, a framework was developed, prioritizing three key themes: communication, commitment and compatibility. Within these themes, nine key factors were identified and then evaluated by academic and industry stakeholders in New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Trust, expectations, reciprocity, coordination, vision, learning, resources, reputation, and recognition were confirmed as important factors for sustainable WIL relationships. The framework provides good practice guidelines for all WIL stakeholders.

<div class="abstract">

    In recent years concerns have been raised about a gap emerging between graduate attributes and what industry requires (Yap, 1997; Albrecht and Sack, 2000). This is often referred to as a lack of ‘employment readiness’ of students and the need to engage industry with students and the curriculum. Such a concern was highlighted in the 2007 report titled ‘Graduate Employability Skills’ prepared for the Business, Industry and Higher Education Collaboration Council. While work integrated learning attempts to address this issue, it is questionable how successful this is if students are not adequately prepared prior to their placement. In an attempt to address this concern a Professional Development Program (the ‘PDP’) was developed. The PDP is integrated into the degree program and is designed to systematically develop students’ learning, employment and generic skills and supplements their theoretical studies. It is argued that this integration of the PDP permeating the Degree enhances students’ employment readiness. In addition, the PDP created other tangential benefits to the students and the university in terms of student engagement and motivation. This paper details the procedures that have been developed, and provides preliminary evidence on the impact of the first part of the PDP. It will be argued by the authors that to attain the possible benefits of a WIL program it is critical that practices and support mechanisms are adopted to emphases the ‘I – that is, the integration of work and learning.

    This chapter considers the disruption in employment and job growth due to the pervasive adoption of cognitive technologies that substitute for or augment humans. The educational system, which operates on regulated and prescribed practices for many academic majors, will be tested by rapidly changing requirements to be gainfully employed. Disruption, due to technological advances of cognitive systems, will be a constant in graduates’ professional life. We make a case for the adaptive innovator or T-shaped professional as the individual best suited to adapting to disruptions and constant change. Emphasis is placed on the importance of internships and co-ops as the strongest learning strategy institutions can use if they adjust their program practices for longer, continuous learning periods, and higher outcome expectations.

    This study aimed to examine the effects of leadership behavior and emotional intelligence (EI) on readiness for change and to investigate the moderating effects of organizational commitment on the relationship among leadership behavior, EI, and readiness to change. Data was collected using surveys and Partial least squares structural equations modeling (PLS SEM) was employed. The findings of the study indicated that leadership behavior and EI have significant effects on employees’ readiness for change. More importantly, it confirmed the moderating effect of organizational commitment. This study provides an empirical explanation of the joint effect of some crucial change management determinants.

    Failed change efforts are commonly blamed on inadequate change management competence, which in turn drives the search for, and selection of, change management solutions — in the form of tailor-made programmes, speciﬁc actions, or sets of skills (supported by an emerging industry of approaches, methodologies and technologies). Organisational change, however, cannot be ‘managed’ in this way, any more effectively than individual change can be ‘managed’ through psychotherapy. In both cases, a process can be initiated, but its outcomes cannot be guaranteed. Attempts to achieve certainty of outcome arise from the wish to avoid pain: but they are likely to result — paradoxically — in more permanent and serious damage to the people involved.

    This paper addresses the nature of the concept of quality in relation to higher education. It analyses ways of thinking about quality, considers their relevance to higher education, explores their interrelationships and examines their philosophical and political underpinnings. The relative nature of quality is examined. First, quality means different things to different people. Second, quality is relative to ’processes’ or ’outcomes’. The widely differing conceptualisations of quality are grouped into five discrete but interrelated categories. Quality can be viewed as exception, as perfection, as fitness for purpose, as value for money and as transformative.

    Graduate capability and employability are regarded as critical success factors for degree programs by universities, industry, and the students. Furthering work-based experiences for academic credit within degree programs is being increasingly explored to assist employability. Effective work-based experiences are reliant on good partnerships between university, industry and student. Such successful relationships assist communication and understanding important for meaningful, quality work-based learning experiences and assessments. Collaborative governance is a finely nuanced arrangement that is dependent on commitment, shared understanding and building trust across university, industry and student guided by the student learning outcomes. Collaborative governance is presented in this paper as an effective framework to guide and organize the structures and processes of university, industry and student to facilitate work-based learning that supports student capability through the attainment of desired outcomes.

    Work integrated learning (WIL) has been embraced as a valuable pedagogy by many Australian law schools, which offer students the opportunity to engage in a variety of WIL including clinical legal education, placements in law firms and industry projects. However, there is widespread recognition that WIL pedagogies have unique resourcing requirements in terms of workload and infrastructure. In addition, there is evidence that academic contribution to WIL pedagogies is not positively regarded in the context of academic advancement. This article explores the resources required to deliver legal WIL and presents novel data about how this is being accommodated by Australian law schools.

    Our world abounds with constant, relentless change to the extent that most people no longer have an open mind about it. Unequivocally, they want it to stop. Many organizations have initiated change programs which have failed. Often, such failures are blamed on staff or on external constraints, such as cost, workload, and legislation. In this study, more than 500 responses were obtained from participants who completed the statement: “The three biggest obstacles to bringing about effective change in my organization are . . .” A total of 89 per cent of these responses pointed to factors within the organization itself.

    A 70 per cent failure rate is frequently attributed to organizational-change initiatives, raising questions about the origins and supporting evidence for this very speciﬁc statistic. This article critically reviews ﬁve separate published instances identifying a 70 per cent organizationalchange failure rate. In each instance, the review highlights the absence of valid and reliable empirical evidence in support of the espoused 70 per cent failure rate. Organizational-change research and scholarship now exists which enables us to question the belief in inherent organizational-change failure rates. Inherent failure rates are critically questioned in terms of the ambiguities of change, the context-dependent nature of change, competing perceptions, temporal aspects and measurability. In conclusion, whilst the existence of a popular narrative of 70 per cent organizational-change failure is acknowledged, there is no valid and reliable empirical evidence to support such a narrative.

The essence of the Deming philosophy is that quality must be the pre-eminent consideration in any strategy aimed at long-term success. Within this context, the idea of what constitutes true quality in higher education is discussed followed by an explanation of how Deming’s famous ‘14 points’ are as applicable to colleges and universities as they are to business and industry. The author then explains how the ‘14 points’ can be used as a framework for ensuring quality, customer satisfaction and greater accountability within the collegiate environment.

    This paper identifies structural barriers faced by postsecondary students from diverse groups (women, racialized people, people with disabilities, and Indigenous peoples) when accessing work-integrated learning (WIL) programs. Drawing on the ecological model approach, this paper examines the challenges to inclusive WIL in Canada at the macro-level by looking at government funding for WIL programs; the meso-level by considering employer participation in WIL programs; and at the micro-level, by analyzing individual students’ demographic characteristics. In considering micro-level factors, a quantitative approach is used to analyze the demographic characteristics of WIL applicants, while for meso-level factors, the paper utilizes a qualitative analysis of semi- structured interviews designed to capture employer perspectives. The study provides recommendations for policy-making, considers practical implications, and makes suggestions for future research. (DEI)

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) is widely considered instrumental in equipping new graduates with the required employability skills to function effectively in the work environment. Evaluation of WIL programs in enhancing skill development remains predominantly outcomes-focused with little attention to the process of what, how and from whom students acquire essential skills during work placement. This paper investigates best practice in the classroom and placement activities which develop employability skills and identifies factors impeding skill performance during WIL, based on survey data from 131 undergraduates across different disciplines in an Australian university. What students actually experienced during placement, or what they felt was important to their learning, broadly aligns with best practice principles for WIL programs and problems experienced in performing certain skills during placement can be largely attributed to poor design. Implications for academic and professional practitioners are discussed.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt student employability, institutional graduate outcomes, and quality talent pipelines. However, there are many caveats to this, such as course-wide ﬂexible and scaﬀolded design, sustained external partner engagement, adequate resourcing, and ongoing evaluation that informs quality, inclusive practice. This article unpacks the challenges and opportunities for advancing WIL in Australian higher education, recognising that many of these extend to other regions and education systems. Managing challenges is critical to fulﬁlling WIL’s potential for social transformation and overcoming inequality, particularly given stakeholders’ expectations of WIL (and potential over-reliance on it).

    This paper explores particular ways that accounting education is preparing students for future work and strategies for improvement. This is critical for accounting educators worldwide given the global pressure on higher education institutions (HEIs) to develop career-ready graduates, accelerated by widespread measurement of institutional performance using graduate employment metrics, weakening graduate labour markets, and increased attention on the value of completing degree studies. HEIs are seeking ways to enhance their students’ employability through embedded teaching and learning interventions, co-curricular offerings (for example, leadership awards and mentoring programs) and encouraging students to engage in extra-curricular activities, such as volunteering hubs and competitions. Accounting is no exception with recent studies examining the extent to which courses are preparing students for the profession and industry (Elijido-Ten &amp; Kloot, 2015; Jackson, 2018a; Stanley &amp; Xu, 2019) and the importance of integrating authentic learning to enhance student employability within the discipline (Dean, Perkiss, Simic Misic, &amp; Luzia, 2018).

    This study examines employer understanding of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL), reasons for participation and the challenges and barriers posed during the WIL process. This is important given the drive to grow WIL, augmented by the National Strategy for WIL, and the significant benefits it holds in preparing students for their transition to employment. The study was undertaken by the four publicly funded Western Australian universities, in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, and is focused on work placements among business students. Findings indicate employers had very little understanding of WIL offerings at the four Business Schools. While employers generally believed that student work placements are useful for their industry sectors, a number of issues impacted on their engagement in WIL. These included identifying suitable projects and tasks for students to complete; sourcing suitable students; concerns with student performance and capacity to mentor/supervise. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research tools were used with data gathered by an employer survey (N = 112) and focus group sessions (N = 17). The study recommends a number of ways to alleviate barriers and challenges to improve the WIL experience for all stakeholders and ensure the sustained growth of WIL in the higher education sector.

<div class="abstract">

    The explicit linking of institutional funding to in-curricular industry engagement and graduate employment aﬃrms the strategic importance of enhancing graduate employability in Australia. Key strategies to enhance graduate employability and employment outcomes are work-integrated learning (WIL) (where students engage with industry as part of their formal learning and assessment) and cocurricular activities (e.g. volunteering, leadership/award, and mentoring programmes), which are facilitated by the university but not embedded into curricula. While WIL is widely recognised for enhancing diﬀerent aspects of student employability, the impact of co-curricular activities is less well-known. Further, there is a lack of empirical analysis on the nuanced impact of diﬀerent forms of WIL and co-curricular activities on graduate outcomes. This research sought to explore the impact of a range of WIL and co-curricular activities on labour force outcomes among new higher education graduates. Findings are informed by national survey data for 51,883 domestic graduates of both coursework and research degrees in Australia. They point to a strong labour market advantage from work-based WIL for Bachelor graduates, while undergraduate participation in co-curricular activities appeared to have less eﬀect on labour force outcomes. However, there were consistent, positive results for industry mentoring and leadership/award programmes for increasing the chances of securing full-time work and reducing the likelihood of perceived overqualiﬁcation among Bachelor and postgraduate coursework graduates. Implications for stakeholders and practice are discussed, as well as directions for future research.

    The focus of this article is on strategies and guidelines for external facilitators withdrawing from planned change projects in organizations. The article is intended for individuals working as facilitators as well as researchers interested in studying facilitation in planned change projects. Given the limited research that exists on this topic, the themes for facilitators withdrawing from a change project are based on ideas identified in general theories, empirical evidence involving organizational change processes, and sustainability literature related to project termination. The themes are related to a style of facilitation that supports, enables, and encourages individual team members and the team as a whole to work towards improving organizational processes and outcomes. The primary goals for this style of facilitation include increasing motivation and commitment, and individual and team learning. It is clear from this review that more research is needed regarding the facilitator’s withdrawal from planned change projects. However, the literature does offer practitioners some guidance for project withdrawal strategies.

    The higher education sector operates in an increasingly complex global environment that is placing it under considerable stress and resulting in widespread change to the operating context and leadership of higher education institutions. The outcome has been the increased likelihood of conﬂict between academics and senior leaders, presaging the need for more engaged and broader approach to leadership. Based on empirical research into the Australian university sector, this paper contends that a distributed leadership (DL) approach is appropriate for the higher education sector and oﬀers value for supporting eﬀective change. In acknowledging the paradigm change needed to implement a DL approach successfully, the authors present a process model to underpin the shift from a leader-centric to a DL approach. The Sustainable Enabling and Evaluating Reﬂective DL change process model presents a synthesis of how a systemic change to DL in higher education can occur.

    While university change initiatives have become more common in the face of changing learner needs and higher education funding, many fail to produce desired eﬀects, even when guided by organizational change models. The purpose of this study was to document a successful change process in an engineering department at a Hispanic-serving institution in the southwestern United States. The change eﬀort focused on enhancing faculty capacity to support diverse student success. The change process was planned using Kotter’s eight-step change model (1996) and was therefore a prescribed, linear, sequential change process. Qualitative analysis of audio-recorded faculty interviews and meetings, artifacts, ﬁeld notes, and participant observation highlights how Kotter’s change model was implemented iteratively and emergently. Early steps were revisited and strategies were treated as improvable. This approach enhanced faculty buy-in and project success. Characterization of each step provides insight into ways to apply Kotter’s change model in higher education settings.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) is a national priority and a strategic direction for Australian universities. To increase industry engagement, there is a need to identify emerging WIL models that enable flexibility while optimizing outcomes for stakeholders. This Australian Technology Network (ATN) project explored approaches that overcome constraints to engagement, particularly for small to medium enterprises (SMEs). The preliminary qualitative phase comprised a literature review, workshops and interviews. Examples of emerging WIL models, both curricula and co-curricular, were clustered into five models: micro-placements, online projects or placements, hackathons, competitions and events, incubators/ start-ups and consulting. This paper outlines these models and summarizes defining features, enablers, challenges and opportunities. Contemporary trends informing innovative WIL design and implementation emerged. Features fell into three broad areas, stakeholder engagement, design elements and co-design with partners. Enablers, challenges and opportunities in the implementation of these WIL models that respond to the changing nature of work were documented.

    As the world reacts to the impact of COVID-19, work-integrated learning (WIL) programs globally are similarly affected. Across Canada and Australia, thousands of WIL students either shifted to working remotely or dismissed from their WIL experience. This disruption impacted student learning, program delivery, risk management, staff capability, and industry engagement, and posed significant challenges for institutions. This paper presents the responses to COVID-19 by the University of Waterloo, Canada, and RMIT University, Australia, each guided by quality WIL principles and different WIL organizational structures. This paper outlines how each institution: mobilized staff, introduced program changes while maintaining quality, engaged industry partners and presented WIL program-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges. The paper concludes with discussion on challenges and opportunities that events such as COVID-19 has upon WIL programs, implications for other institutions and student outcomes. Consideration is given to post-COVID scenarios, and how WIL might need to be re-imagined.

    Most major change initiatives—whether in- tended to boost quality, improve culture, or reverse a corporate death spiral—generate only lukewarm results. Many fail miserably.
Why? Kotter maintains that too many managers don’t realize transformation is a process, not an event. It advances through stages that build on each other. And it takes years. Pressured to accelerate the process, managers skip stages. But short- cuts never work.
Equally troubling, even highly capable managers make critical mistakes—such as declaring victory too soon. Result? Loss of momentum, reversal of hard-won gains, and devastation of the entire transforma- tion effort.
By understanding the stages of change— and the pitfalls unique to each stage—you boost your chances of a successful transfor- mation. The payoff? Your organization flexes with tectonic shifts in competitors, markets, and technologies—leaving rivals far behind.

    The University of Victoria, Canada, strives to enhance undergraduate students’ labor market readiness through work-integrated learning (WIL) experiences. Students with disabilities have historically encountered low participation and success rates in WIL, potentially resulting in their under-representation in the post-graduation labor market. To address this issue, the CanWork program was created, aimed at eliminating participation barriers in co-operative education for students with disabilities. The program offered tailored support, including job development, one-on-one guidance at all stages, and the removal of grade point average (GPA) thresholds. As of its completion in September 2022, the CanWork program facilitated pre-employment training for 107 students with disabilities and 84 co-op work placements. Demographic-specific and personalized support mechanisms boosted participation and success rates for students with disabilities in work-integrated learning. Furthermore, an analysis of program data highlights that GPA requirements in well-resourced programs create unnecessary barriers for students with disabilities. (DEI)

<div class="abstract">

    We investigated the quality of work-integrated learning (WIL) assessment design, in higher education programs, through review of peer-reviewed studies published internationally and in English, 1990–2015. Such a review is timely in light of vested interest from a range of WIL stakeholders; high-level endorsement of WIL across university programs; a regulatory environment requiring development and assurance of higher-order learning outcomes; and a WIL assessment literature that identifies a number of challenges and opportunities. We searched six electronic databases, yielding 20 intervention studies that met inclusion criteria. Findings reveal high-quality assessment design, albeit a need for greater involvement of industry/professional partners in assessment practices, and stronger alignment between reflective activities and students’ WIL experiences. The evidence base under review largely comprised qualitative and mixed methods studies, with indication that the quality of study design had improved over time, although variably across disciplinary fields. The key recommendation from this review is that resources are needed to support research-active WIL academics and partners and students: a). to design and participate in assessment practices, which promote integration of student learning, across university and work settings, and achievement of higher-order learning outcomes; and b). to pursue a collaborative research agenda involving robust evaluation research, inclusive of quantitative studies.

    This review, conducted on behalf of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), aims to identify what can be learned about effective approaches to the development and delivery of employer-sponsored, work-integrated higher education (HE) programmes. The term ’work-integrated’ is used both as a broader term than ’work-based’, and to emphasise connectedness of learning as opposed to academic and workplace learning taking place in parallel but independently of each other. The review seeks to inform practice regarding degrees that include workplace learning and are sponsored by an employer, and particularly the development of degree apprenticeships. Its focus is on programmes that lead to an undergraduate or postgraduate higher education qualification and contain a substantial period of work-integrated learning that contributes to the accredited outcomes of the programme. It excludes programmes with short work placements, and it is not specifically designed to inform practice related to the provision of foundation degrees or level 4 or 5 apprenticeships, although much of the discussion will be relevant to them as well as, in part, to shorter collaborative programmes.

    Work integrated learning (WIL) encompasses educational experiences that merge academic knowledge and practical application in a professional setting, benefiting both students and the existing workforce. The objective of incorporating WIL into education is to foster the integration of theoretical understanding by engaging students in a combination of academic coursework and hands-on work-related activities. With the rise in unemployment, WIL appears to help organizations to get graduates that have all the attributes and skills relevant in the world or work, thereby expanding and growing their businesses ensuring greater prosperity for all concerned. The aim of this article was to assess the role Work Integrated Learning in accelerating Graduate Employability. Four WIL coordinators from different academic programmes that offer WIL as a module participated in this paper. Data was analysed using Thematic analysis, following Braun &amp; Clark steps. The study revealed a direct correlation between academic performance and practical application in the professional setting. This paper therefore argues that WIL programmes can contribute immensely to the overall development of graduates and increase their chances of employment. The study revealed that WIL coordinators should review placement arrangements to improve WIL. This study found that Work Integrated Learning (WIL) has a positive effect on graduate employability and skills development, and that university WIL coordinators should review placement arrangements to ensure that students have enough training and development prior to placement.

    With a government agenda to increase university participation, and larger numbers of students being ‘first-in-family’ to attend university, students have a limited understanding and appreciation of their chosen profession. Adverse implications include reduced motivation towards study and non-appreciation of the required skills to succeed in the work force. Work integrated learning (WIL) can provide these career skills and understanding. This article analyses whether students undertaking an external off-campus internship in their 2nd and 3rd years of a business degree assists in ‘realizing the professional’ within. Building on prior research for 1st year students, the article examines the effects on students’ professional skills and professional identity of an off-campus internship while studying part-time. The results demonstrate the important role of WIL, with WIL students demonstrating greater improvement in professional skills and professional identity. Resources for WIL should be provided to conform to the government’s aspiration for greater university participation.

    With an interest in organizing discourses and attention to issues of power, I reconsider the relationship between communication and organizational change to better understand why change fails and what we can do about it. Speciﬁcally, I argue change fails because talk of change often suppresses, rather than celebrates, the emergence of conﬂicting organizational meanings. Embracing a constitutive perspective of communication and the notion that organizations are tension-ﬁlled, political sites of meaning-making talk, I argue that change fails when local articulations of alternative organizing discourses are unable to permeate mutually reinforcing understandings of organization. Meaningful change is thus enabled by creating open discursive spaces for organizational participants to constitute new organizing discourses. I provide the ﬁndings of a critically inspired, qualitative study of organizational change at a college of art and design to illustrate how embracing a constitutive-political perspective of communication can reveal how discourse alignment and conﬂict suppression during conversations contribute to failing change practices. This contribution provides a critically sensitive, discursive perspective of why change fails and extends an invitation for organizational scholars and practitioners to consider how conﬂictual conversations about a variety of possible organizational futures might better enable sustained organizational-change practices.

    In many parts of the world, including Canada, there are calls for an increase in the number of workintegrated learning opportunities for post-secondary students. As attention is paid to increasing the quantity of WIL programs, it is critically important to ensure that attention is also paid to the quality of WIL experiences for key stakeholders. This paper provides an overview of the quality landscape in higher education and work-integrated learning and presents a work-integrated learning quality framework: AAA★. The AAA★ framework, and the remainder of the paper, is comprised of five sections: (1) concepts and terminology used in the framework; (2) the aims of each of the WIL stakeholder groups; (3) the actions required by each stakeholder to ensure success; (4) the achievements of each of the stakeholder groups; and (5) a continuous improvement process for WIL programs. This work will enable those responsible for WIL programs to identify potential gaps in providing quality WIL as well as providing a list of potential outcomes and measures that can be used to evaluate WIL programs.

<div class="abstract">

    This paper presents a systematic literature review that focuses on the topics of change and leadership in Higher Education, in order to synthesis existing research in this key emerging area and provide some direction for future research. A review framework and method are outlined, in order to clarify the type and source of literature to be reviewed and the focus of this review process. Then, findings are analysed and presented, and thematic areas identified and analysed. Gaps in research are then explored followed by a conclusion and recommendations. Initially, 80 relevant articles were identified from Scopus and Academic Search Complete since 2010. Through abstract review, articles, which did not adequately relate to change and leadership were removed. The final number of papers reviewed and thematically analysed in detail were 23. This research confirms that there has been a steady output of peer-reviewed journal articles published that focused on both leadership and change in Higher Education. Through thematic analysis, several key themes emerged. These included an array of change drivers and the internal and external context associated with politics, culture and traditions and the developmental stage of the higher educational system. Staff utilisation, collaboration and development were additional themes identified that set the scene to determine effective leadership approaches and characteristics. The final theme identified was leadership recruitment and development. Many knowledge gaps from an instrumental, humanistic, critical, and philosophical perspective were identified. It is hoped that this literature review will aid further scholars in their research and develop new knowledge so that convergent views on this important topic will surface.

    Faculty views on their involvement with work‐integrated (WIL) learning programs is an under‐researched area, yet faculty involvement and commitment is vital to the successful running of such programs. This research investigates faculty views of a WIL program at the University of Waikato and covers four main areas; their perceptions of the value of their involvement with WIL, faculty views on the value of work placements for students and influence on student performance, faculty views on the influence of placements on student skill development and future directions and faculty perceptions of assessment of placements. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, science and engineering faculty (N = 142) were surveyed using both open and closed questions. Faculty were generally supportive of the WIL program, which is seen as enhancing the university’s reputation, and as a good tool for student recruitment. They felt that negative impacts included a lack of recognition in workload models and promotion, and that their involvement with WIL did not improve joint research or joint funding opportunities. Faculty perceived that students learned new skills on placement, which were not learned at university, and that WIL students were more employable than their non‐WIL counterparts. In contrast, WIL students were not viewed as being better prepared for graduate studies or writeup of thesis ‐ despite thinking that writing placement reports enhanced students’ writing skills. WIL students were seen as equally suitable for graduate studies, but WIL is not viewed as engaging students in deep learning. (Journal of Cooperative Education &amp; Internships, 43(1), 36‐53).

<div class="abstract">

    Many organisations have found it difficult to implement organisational change successfully. This paper using a systematic and meta-analysis review of the literature published between 1980 and 2011 explored the major reasons for organisational change failure. Unsuccessful change programmes were attributed to insufficient education and training, employees’ apathy, inadequate management support, poor leadership, inappropriate organisational culture, inadequate resources, poor communication, inappropriate planning, insufficient customer focus, and lack of a monitoring and measurement system. Change-programme implementation and its impact depend on the ability of managers to adopt and adapt the change programme principles in their organisations. A well-designed, wisely adapted and well-implemented change programme helps managers achieve desired results. Identification of those factors that contribute to change success or failure enables change leaders to develop effective strategies for enhancing the chances of achieving desired outcomes.

    This paper evaluates the development of skills during a work placement year within a Scottish accounting degree. It discusses the history of placements within higher education, the advantages and disadvantages of placements from student and employer perspectives, and work placement as a vehicle for developing personal transferable skills. Students and employers involved in work placements agreed that they were effective in developing a range of skills. Their views were then compared with those of students at a similar university without a placement degree. Degrees including a work placement were found to be a useful complement to more traditionally structured degrees.

    Recent college graduates face more uncertainty in finding employment today than they have in the past (Spreen, 2013). Colleges and universities encourage students to participate in internships to increase their employment potential. Participation in internships is one of 10 practices that the Association of American Colleges and Universities has designated as “high-impact” for their promise in fostering engagement, persistence, and learning among undergraduate students (Brownell &amp; Swaner, 2010; Kuh, 2008). Although no consensus for the definition of internship exists, O’Neill (2010) suggests that internships are generally experiential learning opportunities that include reflection, onsite guidance, and the ability to gain exposure to a career a student is considering in a real-world setting. Despite the rising popularity of internships and other high-impact practices in college curricula and cocurricula, until recently, little empirical research had been conducted to confirm anecdotal evidence suggesting the power of this educational experience for student learning (Brownell &amp; Swaner, 2010).

The author argues that leadership expertise is developmental and evolutionary, requiring continual reﬁnement, with experience acting as a scaﬀold and even perhaps an incubator as leaders develop their own nuanced skills and perspectives. Using her experience of 15 years as Head of School and then Dean in the same Faculty, the author describes the many faces of her leadership, and reﬂects on the often hidden personal face of enacting walk the walk and not talk the talk leadership practice.

    Although indispensable for long-term economic growth, organizational changes are usually met with resistance. This article draws on psychological theories and empirical evidence to highlight why and under what conditions changes lead to resistance and what likely consequences of resistance are. Furthermore, the article discusses the variables that have been identified as success factors for organizational change initiatives. These include individual difference variables and objective characteristics of the changes, but in particular aspects of the implementation, such as fairness and trust, adequate communication strategies, leadership, and participation. Finally, conclusions summarizing the most important aspects that are beneficial to consider in managing organizational change initiatives are presented.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL) provides an opportunity to develop the skills, knowledge, competence, and experience, which increase employability and lead to more satisfying careers. Research indicates that WIL results in improved academic- and occupationally-related outcomes. However, there is a paucity of quantitative research examining the psychological impact of WIL. The study aimed to determine whether students who pursue WIL in the UK, differ significantly in terms of self-concept, self-efficacy, hope, study skills, motivation, and procrastination than students who have not participated in WIL. The methodology used a cross-sectional analysis of a large sample (n=716) of undergraduate students at the University of Huddersfield, UK. Results showed significant differences predominantly centred upon measures which pertain to students’ confidence in setting and attaining goals. The increased hope and confidence in goal attainment suggest that gaining work experience perhaps enhances the ability to set and achieve goals once in the work force.

    Change is hard, especially when it comes to higher education. Often, employees will resist change because they prefer their usual routines. The change agent — usually an academic leader — has to be academically and professionally prepared to lead such change. One framework for introducing change into higher education settings is John Kotter’s 8‐Step Change Model.

    Background Longstanding data have established that women earn about 20% of undergraduate degrees in engineering; they also have lower academic self-efﬁcacy in the science, technology, engineering, and math ﬁelds than do men. This study examines these ﬁndings through a longitudinal design that explores whether cooperative education (co-op) can improve the retention of women (and men) in their undergraduate studies.
Purpose This study examines the effect on retention of demographic characteristics, cooperative education, contextual support, and three dimensions of self-efﬁcacy – work, career, and academic – and their change over time. It incorporates longitudinal measures and a data check at the end of the students’ ﬁfth year. Design/Method Respondents ﬁlled out 20-minute surveys, approximately one year apart, during three separate time periods. The study introduced and validated a number of new scales. The data for each time period were submitted to successive analyses.
Results The ﬁndings veriﬁed the study’s pathways model. Academic achievement and academic self-efﬁcacy, as well as contextual support in the case for women, in all time periods were critical to retention. Work self-efﬁcacy, developed by students between their second and fourth years, was also an important factor in retention, although it was strongly tied to the students’ participation in co-op programs. Higher retention was associated with an increased number of co-ops completed by students.
Conclusion Relationships between work self-efﬁcacy and co-op participation and between academic self-efﬁcacy and academic achievement play a critical role in retention for both male and female students.

    Developing a Quality Assurance Framework that Addresses Experiential Learning and Work Integrated Learning: Lessons learnt from George Brown College Throughout the College academic world there has always been a need for marrying the didactic classroom material with the applied learning and experiential approach. At George Brown College we stated boldly a commitment to ensure that every student would experience a quality field experience in our strategic path for vision 2020. In order to provide a student with a quality experience we needed to undertake a process that identified quality, currency and authenticity in our offerings. This paper speaks to the necessary quality framework that continues to be refined in our quest of delivering on the George Brown College promise with respect to experiential and work integrated learning.

    Evidence-Based Change Management is the science-informed practice of managing planned organizational change. It reflects two key principles: 1) Planned change is more likely to succeed when using science-informed practices, and 2) Regular use of four sources of evidence (scientific, organizational, stakeholder, and practitioner experience) improve the quality of change-related decisions. We describe two sets of science-informed practices: 1) Ongoing Actions used throughout the change process (e.g., goal setting, vision communication, and feedback/redesign) and 2) Phased Actions each timed to a specific change phase (e.g., early diagnosis or late-stage institutionalization).

    The Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching commissioned this report to identify good practices in work-integrated learning (WIL) in Australia through a systematic review of current approaches in universities in Australia and elsewhere. This report takes up where Janice Orrellâs 2011 benchmark report left off and provides contemporary case studies of good practice evident in 13 Australian universities and from two overseas universities. There has been considerable progress since Orrellâs report was published, especially around issues of scale, resources, whole of institution approaches, and integration into the curriculum. However, issues around access and equity, Indigenous student participation and international student experience remain works in progress. This report focuses on answering the following questions: What is WIL? What evidence is there that WIL experiences have improved graduate employability? How are WIL programs organised? What are some examples of good practice? What are some of the issues around implementing WIL across a university? For the purposes of this report a good practice is one that has been proven to work well and embodies a successful experience that has been tested and validated in and through practice and from which others, across a variety of contexts, can apply and benefit

<div class="abstract">

    University teaching is complicated by competing pressures on academic staff. Imperatives including research, and engagement with community are just two of the myriad pressures that academics balance in careers of full workloads and shifting external demands. This chapter highlights the tensions inherent in the introduction of new priorities, in this case, practice-based learning. It provides a case study of a single institution and offers a perspective on successful implementation that includes consideration of workload, resourcing and a shared vision for pedagogical change.

    The educational benefits of embedding hands-on experience in higher education curriculum are widely recognized (Beard &amp; Wilson, 2013). However, to optimize the learning from these opportunities, they need to be grounded in empirical learning theory. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of internships in Ontario colleges and universities, and to assess the congruence between the components of these internships and Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning framework. Information from 44 Ontario universities and colleges, including 369 internship program webpages and 77 internship course outlines, was analyzed. The findings indicated that internship programs overemphasize the practical aspect of the experience at the expense of linking theory and practice. To optimize experiential education opportunities, recommendations include establishing explicit learning activities consistent with each experiential learning mode, including practice, reflection, connecting coursework and practical experience, and implementing creative ideas in practice.

    Storytelling is a two-way interaction, written or oral, between someone telling a story and one or more listeners. It is a well-known and powerful means of communicating messages and engaging audiences. In this commentary paper, we present a framework for the integration of storytelling in systematic reviews and systematic maps at the stages where stakeholders are actively involved. Using storytelling to explain complex research has, in the past, not been considered a rigorous method of communicating science. But an increasing number of studies are showing how narratives can be useful for developing trust with an audience and increasing knowledge retention as well as the ability and willingness by audiences to learn and take action. Being easily digested by the human brain, stories help bridging between our logos and pathos; when an audience becomes emotionally receptive of facts, chances increase that they will respond and act on the knowledge. Here, we argue that storytelling holds potential as a tool in systematic reviews and systematic maps, serving mainly two purposes. First, collecting contextual narratives from stakeholders at the stages of question formulation and protocol writing can help to inform and generate relevant research questions and review designs. Here, we refer to contextual narratives as stories gathered from stakeholders to gain an understanding of their perspective. Second, creating a final story that faithfully presents the review results, while also relating to the contextual narratives, can contribute to effective communication of the results to stakeholders as well as to a broader audience. This approach can increase their engagement with the science and the implementation of evidence-based decisions. The paper concludes that storytelling holds untapped potential for communicating evidence from systematic reviews and maps for increased stakeholder engagement. It is time for researchers and research networks such as the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence to support and emphasize the importance of exploring new tools for effective science communication, such as storytelling.

<div class="abstract">

    Theoretical roots of higher education institutions (HEIs) and Stakeholder Analysis date back to mid-1990s and research was focussed on the role of HEIs in society and sustainable development. While various studies have been published about ‘triple-helix model’ - bringing government, academia, and industry closer, the concept of HEIs and Stakeholder Analysis needs a comprehensive review of the work carried out till date. Bibliometric and content analyses were performed, incorporating citations from Scopus’ database during last 25 years. Thematic mapping was carried out and evolving trends were identiﬁed. Findings and analysis of this research disclosed that during the last 25 years there has been a growing interest among scholars towards Stakeholder Analysis and HEIs. It was also noted that majority of research pursuits concentrated in western countries such as USA and UK, while Africa, Asia and South America were under-represented. This work will not only lay a foundation for academics to carry out further research, but it will also give new insights to the policymakers which would enable them to device strategies aiming at enhanced participation of universities/HEIs in the local, regional, and national development.

    COVID-19 calls for new approaches and frameworks for the delivery of work-integrated learning (WIL). Standalone WIL opportunities are also increasingly difficult to realize, with the current economic climate limiting industry resources available for placements and WIL partnerships. The hybridized WIL model presented in this paper thus proposes the scaffolding of simulated WIL experiences into core undergraduate design curriculum to promote deep, authentic, transformational learning, fostering broader student employability. Noting a gap in design educational research relating to embedded scaffolded WIL, the paper refers to examples of scaffolded WIL experiences across core design studio subjects of a four-year embedded honors interior architecture program. Conceived as a way to prepare students for more significant standalone, cross-disciplinary and cross-national WIL, the authors argue that this model develops the professional skills required by industry and better prepares students to navigate the dynamic real-world problems that societies face, particularly during the pandemic.

    There is an increasing focus on the student as the nexus of integrating classroom and workplace learning. In the university context students are learners and in the workplace context students are pre-accredited professionals and in both contexts they can be facilitators of peer learning. Student participation in professional roles through workplace learning experiences are opportunities for transformative learning that shape professional identity formation and a sense of professionalism. Drawing on a higher education literature review of professional identity formation and a case study that explored how professionalism was understood, talked about and experienced by lecturers and students, this paper explores the role of work-integrated learning and its place in the curriculum to enhance professional identity development and professionalism.

<div class="abstract">

    A study on the effectiveness of engineering education in the development of industryready graduate engineers was conducted among academics and industry experts of engineering disciplines who have relevant experience in work-integrated learning in Australia. The hypothesis was that embedding enhanced work-integrated learning into all study semesters has the increased possibility of developing industry-ready graduate engineers. This paper outlines the research outcomes and an enhanced work-integrated learning framework that might be helpful for improving the industry-readiness of graduating engineers. Based on the research results, the researchers propose the allocation of an appropriate level of work-integrated learning for each indicator of attainment component from the elements of Engineers Australia’s Stage I Competencies. The aim of this paper is to provide detailed recommendations for implementing an enhanced work-integrated model in Bachelor of Engineering programs in Australia. The authors also present the concept of curriculum development based on industry-integrated learning outcomes, as well as the campus and industry engagement model for enhanced work-integrated learning for the subjects of study in the Bachelor of Engineering program. This framework can be used globally as a reference for developing similar work-integrated learning models.

    Work-integrated learning (WIL), particularly workplace-based WIL, provides international students with opportunities to be exposed to authentic working contexts, consequently enhancing student employability development. However, the literature indicates that many international students struggle in WIL despite continuous eﬀorts by higher education institutions. A scoping review will inform future research and practice that seeks to enhance the WIL experiences of international students. This scoping review, guided by a transition framework, synthesized and analyzed ﬁndings from 22 empirical studies published during 2009–2020 related to challenges to international undergraduate students in WIL. Results show that while a range of challenges to this student cohort in WIL has been well established in the literature, little is known about how international students exercise their agency in navigating challenges to enhance WIL experiences. The scoping review has two major theoretical contributions: (i) establishing a novel typology of challenges to international students in WIL and (ii) proposing a context-speciﬁc research approach which facilitates inquiry into salient aspects of international students’ WIL engagement in given contexts. The review concludes with recommendations for future research and practice from a transition perspective.

    Work integrated learning (WIL) is essential to successful higher education curricula and qualifications. Traditional WIL models are discipline specific with collaboration between educator and business aimed at providing the student with workplace experience. There is a need for a transdisciplinary approach to WIL as well as a need to consider multiple stakeholder responsibility in WIL models.

<div class="abstract">

    While an increase in funding for cooperative education in the United States has seen the growth in work integrated learning, the reduction of government funding support in Australia for work placements has had the unintended eﬀect of threatening the academic integrity of work placement programs. The pedagogy around work integrated learning programs is based on experiential learning theory and can be described by Kolb’s (1984) learning cycle. The key to learning, particularly deep level learning, through work integrated learning, however, rests on the students’ ability to reﬂect on the work experiences, to integrate these experiences with their academic lessons and to conceptualise their learning so that they are able to ultimately bring together their work and their academic experiences to solve problems in unfamiliar environments. The role of academics in supporting student learning through work integrated learning has long been debated and while the evidence in the United States shows that programs that do not have the support and commitment from academics tend to fold, in Australia the commitment from academics to supporting student learning through work integrated learning is very variable. The change in the funding model for work integrated learning programs introduced in Australia by the Deapartment of Education, Science and Technology (DEST) in 2005 could be seen as an incentive to strengthen the academic support in these programs. The impact of the changes has however, not necessarily had the desired outcome.

    The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science presents two special issues in which nine research-based articles and two overviews address various theoretical and empirical perspectives on the process of collaboration and the forms of collaborative alliances. In the first overview, the articles are mapped onto six theoretical perspectives according to how they address the preconditions, process, and outcomes of collaboration. In this overview, the research findings are analyzed in terms of the following overarching issues essential to a comprehensive theory of collaboration: (a) a definition of collaboration, (b) the auspices under which a collaboration is convened and the role of the convener, (c) implications of the collaboration for environmental complexity and participants’ control over the environment, and (d) the relationship between individual participants’ self-interest and the collective interests of all involved in the collaborative alliance. This theoretical analysis indicates several fruitful avenues for future research.

    Student engagement with the world of work or voluntary service has become increasingly prominent in higher education curricula as nations and states seek competitive advantage for their economies. Developments in assessment have lagged behind developments in curricula. It is argued that the incorporation of work-engaged learning into curricula requires a paradigm shift in assessment methodology. Even without such a paradigm shift, work-engaged learning poses some significant challenges for the assurance of quality and standards.
