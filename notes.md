# Notes

Address *fitness for purpose*.

Can I include these two paragraphs back into my text somewhere?
-   In reality, resistance to expanded WIL responsibilities requires the use evidence-based persuasion techniques. For instance, comparing WIL's higher graduate employment rates {% cite cheng_employability_2022 %} with current student knowledge gaps can create a persuasive analytical and emotional appeal {% cite kotter_leading_2012 %}.
-   Citing academic studies about the value of WIL to a group of graphic designers is hardly  an effective method of convincing them of the need for this change. While organizational, stakeholder, and scientific evidence, along with professional judgement are valuable {% cite barends_search_2014 %}, {% cite rousseau_evidence-based_2022 %}, the use of storytelling supports engagement and motivation. It gives individuals' realities meaning. The benefit of storytelling in bolstering engagement is that it does not require expert knowledge. {% cite sundin_rethinking_2018 %}.


I can put this back in the document somewhere:
-   Additionally, not all WIL formats yield equal benefits. Work-based WIL like fieldwork demonstrates the strongest positive impact on employment outcomes, with participants more likely to obtain full-time employment and less likely to feel overqualified compared to non-participants {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}. In contrast, non-workplace WIL like classroom projects shows significantly weaker outcomes, with participants less likely to secure full-time employment {% cite jackson_impact_2023 %}.

This is something I could include at some point:
-   Based on three decades of professional experience in the graphic design industry in the National Capital Region, I have observed that the local employment landscape is predominantly characterized by small businesses, organizations, and creative teams. Unlike design hubs such as Toronto, New York, or Chicago, Ottawa-Gatineau lacks large-scale graphic design employers. Major technology companies that once maintained a significant presence in the region have relocated their operations or have moved to remote work. Large corporations maintain only modest-sized creative departments locally.

Talks about building a coalition, p.15, {% cite kezar_redesigning_2006 %}

-   How am i going to use the content with the stakeholders?
-   Apply it to my topic and 
-   What does it mean when I'm ready to lead the process?
-   What am I going to do with the evidence?
-   Missing the synthesis. What does this mean for my change approach?
-   Draw an inference of what the evidence means.
-   Tie my writing into the Claim Statement.

Doing so is crucial because it minimizes resistance. It aligns the change initiative with the organization’s identity. Ignoring these factors can lead to disengagement, as stakeholders may bristle at changes that conflict with the organization’s cultural values.

-   {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016 %} has a lot of on barriers to engagement on p.17.
-   {% cite ruskin_engaging_2021 %}
    -   Addresses many good points about resistance and obstacles to employer participation.
-   Employers are more inclined to advance discussions and make the required commitments to supervision, evaluation, and feedback in order to ensure high-quality student outcomes if they see the possible advantages and benefits {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %}.

Is the [triple-helix model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_helix_model_of_innovation) worth including? Is it relevant?

## Theme #1: Collaborative Leadership


#### Storytelling

-   {% cite andrews_telling_2018 %}
-   {% cite sundin_rethinking_2018 %}
-   {% cite herman_evidencebased_2017 %}

## Theme #2: Sustained, Inclusive Stakeholder Engagement

-   {% cite peus_leading_2009 %}: Lots of content about resistance to change here.

## Theme #3: Resource Allocation

### Deming
-   {% cite temponi_continuous_2005 %}: This talks about PDSA (PDCA).
-   {% cite stensaasen_application_1995 %}, {% cite hughey_application_2000 %}: These two both talk about Deming's 14 points. Not sure they're relevant. It's not about PDSA.

### Challenges and Resistance

-   This article explores the argument that a potentially significant reason for failure of change efforts is a lack of alignment between the value system of the change intervention and of those members of an organization undergoing the change. {% cite burnes_success_2011 %}

-   {% cite abeysekera_issues_2006 %}: Challenges designing WIL
-   {% cite jackson_embedding_2021 %} has a section on challenges for embedding WIL.

    -   [Mabungelaa](.sources/6WIPGS5Y.html): WIL coordinators are responsible for supervising WIL.

-   {% cite peus_leading_2009 %}: The article discusses the variables that have been identified as success factors for organizational change initiatives. These include individual difference variables and objective characteristics of the changes, but in particular aspects of the implementation, such as fairness and trust, adequate communication strategies, leadership, and participation.

#### Readiness for Change

-   [Why teams fail](./sources/BZE7F32V.html)
-   Stakeholders must be ready for change. [Gelaidan](./sources/HT9UF9K5.html)
-   Then fostering their readiness to undertake the change initiative {% cite conner_committing_1992 %}, {% cite drew_issues_2010 %}, {% cite gelaidan_employee_2018 %}, {% cite janich_facilitator_2016 %}, {% cite radwan_lead_2020 %}. With this shared understanding, each party recognizes the benefits enjoyed by participating {% cite fleming_successful_2018 %}. This builds intrinsic motivation for continued engagement. Absent these robust relationships, distrust can build, resulting in abandonment by some. Creating a strong coalition of stakeholders with clear understanding of the merits of WIL participation ensures ongoing stakeholder engagement. Of the stakeholders, faculty hold a special position as the initiators of WIL activities.

-   The team holds strategic planning sessions to explore and identify roles and responsibilities of each team member. A vision is formulated, including strategic goals of the team, that are aligned with the end state of embedded WIL in the Graphic Design program curriculum {% cite ferns_driving_2016 %}, {% cite lester_work-integrated_2016  %}.
-   Employers play a central role in assessing student success while learning in the workplace. Consequently, employers and faculty need to employ a collaborative approach to ensure students have attained requisite learning outcomes through a rigorous, coordinated assessment process {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 %}
-   Leading this change process requires moving beyond simply describing communication practices. They're not simply a tactic. They are the infrastructure of the change process. They need to address institutional realities and human behaviours. Adopting a multi-level messaging approach which ranges from broadcast using digital newsletters and LMS announcements, to peer-to-peer dialogue using Slack or Teams mitigates cynicism and formalizes best practices into policy.
-   Should I do a gap analysis to uncover shortcomings in student skills they could learn through WIL {% cite dorland_entrepreneurial_2020 %}
-   Arguing the value of embedding WIL.
-   I should be stating that I limited my research. The formats, etc...
