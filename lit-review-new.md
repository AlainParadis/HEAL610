<h2 class="center-text">Leading and Managing Change at Algonquin College</h2>

In keeping with the mandate of Ontario’s publicly supported colleges to respond to ever-changing employment needs in the region {% cite noauthor_ontario_2002 %}, the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College has maintained strong relations with local, sector-specific employers. A key component of the program’s ties to industry is the provision of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL), though the quality and consistency of these activities is deteriorating with time. **This paper presents a literature review focused on leading and managing an organizational change process to embed Work-Integrated Learning as a learning model in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. That change process will be grounded in collaborative leadership, sustained stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation.**

The review examines scholarly works addressing the challenges of implementing sustained, high-quality WIL in the program, with a focus on leading and managing change. The scope includes peer-reviewed studies analyzing stakeholder engagement barriers, and leadership strategies. This review aims to identify evidence-based practices for embedding WIL as a core pedagogical model while addressing faculty workload constraints and inconsistent industry participation.

The analysis has the following structure: current deficiencies in WIL delivery, definitions of quality across stakeholders, leadership approaches for overcoming resistance to change, and mechanisms for sustaining engagement. By evaluating sources through the lens of Kotter’s change management theory, and Deming’s continuous improvement framework, this review contends that WIL’s long-term viability depends on sustained stakeholder engagement, collaborative leadership, and strategic resource allocation.

**[claim statement]** Embedding Work-Integrated Learning in Algonquin College's Graphic Design program is essential for enhancing student employability, building a strong industry talent pipeline, and maintaining faculty currency. Achieving this requires a collaborative leadership approach, sustained stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation to align WIL initiatives with institutional objectives, address existing inconsistencies, and ensure the program’s long-term success.

### What is WIL?

Work-Integrated Learning is an educational approach which is a part of experiential learning that integrates academic learning with practical experience in a professional setting. It is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling students to develop industry-relevant skills. WIL can take various forms, including but not limited to co-op programs, internships, apprenticeships, clinical placements, research partnerships, and community service learning. These experiences may be paid or unpaid, required or optional, and can occur at different points within a program of study. The defining characteristic of WIL is its structured integration within the curriculum, ensuring that workplace experiences contribute meaningfully to students’ academic and professional development {% cite cewil_what_2021 kay_emerging_2019 mabungela_accelerating_2024 stirling_practical_2024 wyonch_class_2023 %}.

### The Importance of WIL in Graphic Design

In the Graphic Design program, WIL is particularly relevant due to the collaborative nature of the field, where mentorship and professional engagement play pivotal roles in shaping students’ skills and career readiness {% cite cutean_impact_2023 mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}.

Students who participate in WIL have a higher GPA than those who do not. They are more satisfied with their programs, and are less worried about their studies {% cite drysdale_motivation_2018 macdonald_realizing_2014 raelin_gendered_2014 parker_differential_2016 purdie_are_2013 raelin_gendered_2014 ramirez_academic_2015 %}

WIL activities support students in building a professional network {% cite usher_why_2020 %}
Employers play a crucial role in WIL initiatives, benefiting from several advantages. WIL serves as a pipeline for recruiting skilled graduates who are familiar with industry practices and expectations. Employers report reduced recruitment costs and risks when hiring graduates who have participated in WIL. Students bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas and cutting-edge knowledge to the workplace, contributing to organizational growth and problem-solving {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 %}. Collaborating with educational institutions fosters long-term relationships that support workforce development {% cite chatoor_working_2023 stirling_practical_2024 %}.

Graduate skills demanded by employers include being confident communicators, team players, critical thinkers, problem solvers and having initiative (Harvey, Moon and Geall, 1997)

-   Faculty currency and network building

-   Addresses institutional goals

Almost half of Ontario’s higher education learners participate in some form of WIL to be better prepared for the workplace {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Research shows that participants in WIL experience superior labour market outcomes, including a higher likelihood of employment and significantly higher incomes {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}. Usher {% cite usher_why_2020 %} claims that WIL is a useful talent scouting opportunity for employers, forging new connections with up-and-coming graduates.

Some educators view the need for HEI to cater to the workplace as being problematic. They claim their imperative is to serve a higher educational purpose. {% cite billett_realising_2009 %}



### The Current State

-   Does not conform with institutional standards
-   Lack of formal documentation
-   Lack variety of typologies
    -   [Mabungela lists typologies](./bibliography/mabungela_accelerating_2024.html), [Patrick et al. typologies, remote WIL](./bibliography/patrick_wil_2008.html)


The Graphic Design program is six semesters long, running in the fall and winter semesters. Despite its importance, WIL in the Graphic Design program is currently limited to a single fieldwork component in the final semester {% cite  algonquin_college_of_applied_arts_and_technology_graphic_2024 %}. During five of the six semesters students participate in no WIL activities.

This insufficient integration fails to meet the demands of both students and industry partners. One WIL experience at the end of the Program of Study delivers too little industry contact, too late in students’ education. Learners benefit from earlier, consistent, high-quality WIL activities with models that are varied and innovative {% cite  mabungela_accelerating_2024 orrell_good_2011 %}. A properly prepared aspiring graphic designer has WIL experiences of varied models in increasing intensity at all stages of their academic journey. Students are exposed to theory then practice in a scaffolded structure progressing throughout the academic curriculum. This model builds momentum, making a smoother transition towards the workplace and future career success {% cite doolan_benefits_2019 kay_emerging_2019 stirling_practical_2024 wyonch_class_2023 %}  rather than an abrupt intensive experience at the end of their studies.

That said, strong disciplinary expertise alone is not adequate preparation for the workplace {% cite crebert_developing_2004 doolan_benefits_2019 %}. Frequent WIL fosters the timely development of professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving {% cite cutean_impact_2023 %}. Early WIL experiences support the student’s choice of vocation early-on, as well as student satisfaction and retention {% cite freudenberg_its_2008 %}. For such frequent and varied WIL activities to happen, all stakeholders must be prepared, enthusiastic, and adequately resourced (Dzingirai, 2020).

### Why Embedding WIL is Good

{% cite doolan_benefits_2019 bosco_embedding_2014 %}: address embedded WIL

Embedding WIL as a learning model in the Program of Study ensures it persists. It also improves quality, notwithstanding institutional changes or budgetary constraints. Institutional recognition of WIL as a learning model in the Graphic Design program contributes to its quality {% cite mcrae_work-integrated_2018 patrick_wil_2008 rosenbaum_planned_2018 %}. With WIL embedded in the program, the college can measure quality through its institutional key performance indicators such as retention graduation, and post-graduation sector-specific employment rates. These results allow stakeholders to respond with adjustments to WIL practice in a continuous improvement process {% cite deming_pdsa_nodate bobby_abcs_2014 %}. Formalizing the inclusion of WIL in the Graphic Design program bolsters its quality into the future. This demonstrates a commitment by the college to endorse WIL as part of its vision of experiential learning.

<h2 class="center-text">Theme #1: Collaborative Leadership</h2>

### Build a Guiding Coalition

Collaborative leadership serves as the foundation for driving this change initiative. The approach involves forming a guiding coalition consisting of faculty members, students, industry partners, and college administrators. This coalition is composed of individuals with enough authority and influence to lead the change process. They will spur stakeholders to work together, to implement needed strategies, and to oversee them during implementation {% cite kotter_leading_2007 bryson_strategic_2018 %}.

<!-- DELETE? [Jones and Harvey](./bibliography/jones_distributed_2017.html) {% cite jones_distributed_2017 %} identify an environment of trust, a culture of respect and the acknowledgement of the need for collaborative leadership as necessary for the change process to succeed. -->

### Fostering Readiness for Change 

-   [Rousseau & ten Have](./bibliography/rousseau_evidence-based_2022.html)

Then fostering their readiness to undertake the change initiative {% cite chappell_exploring_2016 conner_committing_1992 drew_issues_2010 gelaidan_employee_2018 janich_facilitator_2016 kotter_leading_2007 radwan_lead_2020 %}. With this shared understanding, each party recognizes the benefits enjoyed by participating. This builds intrinsic motivation for continued engagement. Absent these robust relationships, distrust can build, resulting in abandonment by some. Creating a strong coalition of stakeholders with clear understanding of the merits of WIL participation ensures ongoing stakeholder engagement. Of the stakeholders, faculty hold a special position as the initiators of WIL activities.

### What Happens when Coalitions Fail?

-   [Failure of leadership](./bibliography/kunert_failure_2018-1.html)
-   [Failure of organizational change](./bibliography/burnes_success_2011.html)
-   Why transformation fails [Kotter](./bibliography/kotter_leading_2007.html)

Without continued faculty engagement in WIL activities, its quality and frequency diminish. Stirling {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %} highlights that instructors must educate themselves about their roles as WIL facilitators and design curriculum that connects with workplace practice. This adds to already burdensome workloads, which, if not included in their standard workload formula, is generally met with resistance {% cite sony_barriers_2020 %}. This lack of recognition is remedied by allocating financial and human resources as a matter of course. This ensures the continuation of WIL activities for the long term, weathering changes in faculty and administrative staff.

A collaborative approach is useful, where stakeholders share a language, mutual understanding and trust to achieve learning outcomes {% cite henderson_strengthening_2017 lauer_change_2021 %}.
