<h2 class="center-text">Leading and Managing Change at Algonquin College</h2>

In keeping with the mandate of Ontario’s publicly supported colleges to respond to ever-changing employment needs in the community {% cite noauthor_ontario_2002 %}, the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College has maintained strong relations with local, sector-specific employers. The faculty are practicing graphic designers who maintain expansive professional networks. One key component of the program’s success is the provision of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) experiences, though the quality and consistency of these activities is deteriorating with time. **This paper presents a literature review focused on leading and managing an organizational change process to embed Work-Integrated Learning as a learning model in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. That change process will be grounded in collaborative leadership, sustained stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation.**

The review examines scholarly works addressing the challenges of implementing sustained, high-quality WIL in the program, with a focus on leading and managing change. The scope includes peer-reviewed studies analyzing stakeholder engagement barriers, and leadership strategies. This review aims to identify evidence-based practices for embedding WIL as a core pedagogical model while addressing faculty workload constraints and inconsistent industry participation.

The analysis has the following structure: current deficiencies in WIL delivery, definitions of quality across stakeholders, leadership approaches for overcoming resistance to change, and mechanisms for sustaining engagement. By evaluating sources through the lens of Kotter’s change management theory, and Deming’s continuous improvement framework, this review contends that WIL’s long-term viability depends on sustained stakeholder engagement, collaborative leadership, and strategic resource allocation.

> Context informing the problem of practice – personal, institutional, and geographical  
> Rationale for your literature choices (especially if from popular sources)

Work-Integrated Learning is a part of experiential learning that blends academic studies with their practical application in a work environment {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. WIL activities include but are not limited to co-op education, fieldwork, internships, applied research projects, hackathons, competitions, and incubators {% cite cewil_what_2021 kay_emerging_2019 %}. Almost half of Ontario’s higher education learners participate in some form of WIL to be better prepared for the workplace {% cite stirling_practical_2024 %}. Research shows that participants in WIL experience superior labour market outcomes, including a higher likelihood of employment and significantly higher incomes {% cite wyonch_class_2023 %}. Usher {% cite usher_why_2020 %} claims that WIL is a useful talent scouting opportunity for employers, forging new connections with up-and-coming graduates.

<h3>The Importance of WIL in the Graphic Design Program</h3>

-   Some educators view the need for HEI to cater to the workplace as being problematic. They claim their imperative is to serve a higher educational purpose. {% cite  %}
