## Questions

-   Should our *Claim Statement* act like a thesis statement for our lit review? Should they be combined?
-   I'm not sure how to formulate a *rationale for your literature choices* in the Background section.
-   Is it poor practice to over-cite <a href="./bibliography/stirling_practical_2024.html">one document</a>? I have one that is 200 pages that contains a lot of relevant information on WIL.
-   I don't have a section literally addressing *Change Management*, but it's woven through my content. Is that ok?

-   Arguing the value of embedding WIL.
-   I should be stating that I limited my research. The formats, etc...
-   I leaned heavily on a single document.
-   In my rationale of the literature, I can state that I searched for Canadian content.
-   Stakeholder salience theory. What is their influence on the process. Address power imbalances.
-   I need to describe the idea of a town hall 

## Purpose

-   The purpose of your literature review is really threefold:
    1.  Provide a general overview of work previously done in this area
    2.  Make an argument for the importance of your proposed change process
    3.  Substantiate your change plan with evidence.

#### Dumping Ground

-   According to Mulvihill, Hart, Northmore, Wolff, and Pratt (2011, p.11), “Each university must negotiate – and re-negotiate - the meaning, value and purpose of engagement with their communities if they are to ensure successful and sustainable partnerships in the long term”.
