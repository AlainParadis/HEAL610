## Purpose

-   The purpose of your literature review is really threefold:
    1.  Provide a general overview of work previously done in this area
    2.  Make an argument for the importance of your proposed change process
    3.  Substantiate your change plan with evidence.

-   Tie my writing into the Claim Statement.

How am i going to use the content with the stakeholders?
Apply it to my topic and 
What does it mean when I'm ready to lead the process?
What am I going to do with the evidence?
Missing the synthisis. What does this mean for my change approach?
Draw an inference of what the evidence means.
