## Questions

-   Should our claim statement act like a thesis statement for our lit review? Should they be combined?
-   Is it poor practice to over-cite <a href="./bibliography/stirling_practical_2024.html">one document</a>? I have one that is 200 pages that contains a lot of relevant information on WIL.
-   I don't have a section literally addressing *Change Management*, but it's woven through my content. Is that ok?

## Notes

-   The purpose of your literature review is really threefold:
    1.  Provide a general overview of work previously done in this area
    2.  Make an argument for the importance of your proposed change process
    3.  Substantiate your change plan with evidence.
