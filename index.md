## Notes

-   The purpose of your literature review is really threefold:
    1.  Provide a general overview of work previously done in this area
    2.  Make an argument for the importance of your proposed change process
    3.  Substantiate your change plan with evidence.

## Lit Review Outline

### Intro
-   Context in Algonquin College and Ontario colleges
    -   [Colleges Act](./sources/JAKUFKT3.html), [About Algonquin](./sources/UHF5TLS8.html), [Program of Study](./sources/S8FNDBA5.html)
-   Scope of Lit Review
-   Structure of Lit Review

#### Claim Statement

-   Embedding Work-Integrated Learning in Algonquin College's Graphic Design program is essential for enhancing student employability, building a strong industry talent pipeline, and maintaining faculty currency. Achieving this requires a collaborative leadership approach, sustained stakeholder engagement, and strategic resource allocation to align WIL initiatives with institutional objectives, address existing inconsistencies, and ensure the program’s long-term success.
